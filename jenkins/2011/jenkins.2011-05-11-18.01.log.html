<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:06:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> that only helps if there's good documentation on what needs to be done as well as monitoring

<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:06:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> which is something we can cover separately :)

<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:07:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yeah, it'd be good to have nagios or something like that.

<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:10:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> He wants to make sure that people don't mind him pushing l10n to plugins

<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:11:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I think it's probably best to do it as pull requests, at least for plugins with active development.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:11:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I don't see any problem because I don't see how anyone else can review them.

<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:11:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> But I'm fine with whatever.
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:11:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I think pushing cool, not cutting releases though
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:11:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bap2000&gt;</span> I'm cool with that
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:11:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> I was thinking about core not plugin. That's a good question. I think it is possible if we don't do releases without maintener agreement first
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:11:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> would be no problem for me - as soon as I've migrated my plugins to github :)
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:11:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Oh, definitely not cutting releases.
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:11:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> No one is asking to do releases, obviously.
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:12:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> And make sure to update the plugin's wiki page with the localization change.

I have set it up to get changes from git, then run a bash/rake/ruby/whatever script. For some reason, it's not running the script. It's weird in a way that the build output doesn't show much more than getting things from git and finishing the build. How could I debug this?

<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">18:30:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Just to set the expectation, one thing I've heard is that the Oracle Hudson team doesn't really care much about a merge, any more than before.
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">18:30:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mwalling&gt;</span> personal feeling, they dont actually want a reunion, they want to make the jenkins project look bad

<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">18:31:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> That there would be one of the conditions to figure out. =)

<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">18:31:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> For Jenkins to merge with hudson = they (sonatype, mainly) got everything they wanted

<a name="l-266"></a><span class="tm">18:36:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;cybernd&gt;</span> from a user perspective: if sonatype is able to integrate a maven release cycle into hudson and eases the pain of javas main buildsystem, then jenkins is not an alternative for hudson (keep in mind that mylyn and m2eclipse are also part of eclipse adding value to the stack)
<a name="l-267"></a><span class="tm">18:36:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I kind of agree that we owe it to our users to try to work it out, but the other part of me thinks that when there's this deep division, I'm not sure how the combined group of people can work productively. I think that's the biggest show-stopper, although it might not be a good enough PR.
<a name="l-268"></a><span class="tm">18:36:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> fair enough, but we never could find out what was driving the split in the first place...

<a name="l-270"></a><span class="tm">18:37:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Plus, it's been made pretty clear that at least some people involved in the Hudson proposal would like to see a reunion, so it seems like we should do something more than just saying "No" and walking away. =)
<a name="l-271"></a><span class="tm">18:37:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> IMHO we should be most concerned with what makes those contributing to core and plugins happy first

<a name="l-279"></a><span class="tm">18:38:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> which is a showstopper, IMO
<a name="l-280"></a><span class="tm">18:38:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aheritier:</span> it'd be managed by Jason and Ted xD

<a name="l-282"></a><span class="tm">18:38:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phyto&gt;</span> as i community developer that's contributed in the past to core and plugins i'd hate to submit that to hudson
<a name="l-283"></a><span class="tm">18:38:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> I'm still working on getting a better understanding of eclipse policy and how flexible it is - I mean, I thought Apache policies weren't particularly flexible until Kohsuke and I had a chat with Doug Cutting and he explained just what you can do. Which was a lot more than I'd thought.

<a name="l-292"></a><span class="tm">18:39:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zx&gt;</span> aheritier, well in my opinion Apache and Eclipse are two well run organizations with good governance and maturity... they have been through it all... from grievance issues (ever had a committer that was poisonous) to trademarks
<a name="l-293"></a><span class="tm">18:39:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zx&gt;</span> rtyler, why do an ASF proposal? what would be different? the name?
<a name="l-294"></a><span class="tm">18:40:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">zx:</span> ASF has a lot to offer in terms of community support, both in users and infrastructure
<a name="l-295"></a><span class="tm">18:40:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d_a_carver&gt;</span> zx, Apache and Eclipse dev processes a bit different.  I'm committer in both.   Eclipse is a bit more formal.
<a name="l-296"></a><span class="tm">18:40:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> ASF takes dogfooding pretty serious :)
<a name="l-297"></a><span class="tm">18:40:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> there are really good pieces to the eclipse proposal though, in that .. removing the lgpl code into extension points with the existing lgpl as default impl
<a name="l-298"></a><span class="tm">18:40:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> they're also a really great bunch of folks, I've been to ApacheCon a couple times, great community over there
<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">18:40:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jieryn:</span> Yeah, I'm a big fan of that.
<a name="l-300"></a><span class="tm">18:40:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> e.g. graph
<a name="l-301"></a><span class="tm">18:40:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> One of the benefits is that it makes it easier for corporations to contribute.
<a name="l-302"></a><span class="tm">18:40:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> IPs control process is many more important on eclipse side I thing (which is a good think for business, but annoying for the community contributors)
<a name="l-303"></a><span class="tm">18:41:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zx&gt;</span> rtyler, eclipse's community relies heavily on build.eclipse.org (and older Hudson instance atm) and other things... the committers dogfood as much as we can
<a name="l-304"></a><span class="tm">18:41:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> But I always like ASF (even if its not easy every day)
<a name="l-305"></a><span class="tm">18:41:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d_a_carver&gt;</span> aheritier, correct that is the hurdle for eclipse is the IP process, but there is a Parallel IP process that can be invoked.
<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">18:41:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Ok, so here's what I'd like to propose.
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">18:41:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">zx:</span> *nod*
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">18:42:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zx&gt;</span> aheritier, well... having good code provenance is a good thing... it protects you and sometimes forces you to minimize your deps (or say get rid of some LGPL deps) and is good thing if you want to maximize who uses you... from commercial to just normal folks
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">18:42:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> <span class="hi">d_a_carver:</span> and I know that it killed few projects which didn't have enought resources to process it
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">18:42:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> zx:I agree
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">18:42:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> 1) We, the Jenkins community, figure out what conditions would need to be met for a reconciliation with the Hudson people, regardless of foundation, etc. Just cultural/technical requirements that we'd need in order to actually work together effectively.
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">18:42:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> <span class="hi">zx:</span> Not fun, but necessary and important
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">18:43:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> 2) We research both Eclipse and ASF as options for submitting Jenkins to, building up a sense of plusses and minuses for both.
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">18:43:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d_a_carver&gt;</span> aheritier, actually in most cases for eclipse IP it comes down to one person being the lead on it.  But the sticky point comes when a dependency is rejected because of unclear IP.  Then an alternative has to be found.  That is what kills a lot of projects.
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">18:43:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I mean, we're in a pretty good position here - the two leading non-Stallman OSS foundations are both interested in giving us a home. =)
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">18:43:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zx&gt;</span> aheritier, tell me about it... been dealing with IP issues for a long time... at least it makes me sensitive to depending on third party stuff...
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">18:43:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> yes.
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">18:44:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d_a_carver&gt;</span> aheritier, an example, is Saxon support in the XSL Tools project at eclipse.  We can redistribute it because of some concerns of IP and permissions.
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">18:44:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#agreed </span><span class="cmdline">on everything abayer just said :P</span>
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">18:44:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d_a_carver&gt;</span> We can't.
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">18:44:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> <span class="hi">zx:</span>  yes. Mmany people don't take care of that enough
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">18:44:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> are you throwing yourself under the bus on taking point on nay of those :)
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">18:44:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zx&gt;</span> aheritier, some good comes out of it though... recently ANTLR rewrote some of their code after eclipse.org found issues with it and now is clean :D
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">18:44:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think the next question then is what are the conditions that we want?
<a name="l-325"></a><span class="tm">18:45:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> This is really two separate questions that need to be answered: can the Jenkins and Hudson projects fold back together? And given the choice, which of Eclipse and ASF feels like the right home for the project?
<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">18:45:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;billbillingsly&gt;</span> sorry to butt in. why does Jenkins need to join an umbrella foundation?
<a name="l-327"></a><span class="tm">18:45:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zx&gt;</span> abayer, I would add a #3) what license do you guys want?
<a name="l-328"></a><span class="tm">18:45:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> MIT
<a name="l-329"></a><span class="tm">18:45:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> zx - true, though I personally think anything in the MIT/ASL/CDL continuum works.
<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">18:45:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zx&gt;</span> EPL? BSD? Apache? joining a foundation may limit your choice
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">18:45:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> EDL, rather.
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">18:46:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> I think a fast way to bring committers in is a must
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">18:46:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> Persoally, i think foundations are a retrograde step
<a name="l-334"></a><span class="tm">18:46:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I'm loathe to require any signatures or goddamn fax machines before a committer can contribute
<a name="l-335"></a><span class="tm">18:46:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> I think the question as posed makes it a false dichotomy
<a name="l-336"></a><span class="tm">18:46:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> :-) Welcome at ESF and ASF :-)

<a name="l-338"></a><span class="tm">18:47:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">billbillingsly:</span> In part because we need a legal umbrella for funds, IP, etc, in part because we'd get a lot of infrastructure/logistical benefits, and in part because of the synergistic relationships you get between projects living in a foundation together.
<a name="l-339"></a><span class="tm">18:47:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> you see other ways?
<a name="l-340"></a><span class="tm">18:47:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> I'd rather carry on as we are, accept contributions from wherever wants to contribute, and parhaps get an umberalla a-la SFLC to sort out legal stuff
<a name="l-341"></a><span class="tm">18:47:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I should also say that I *strongly* don't think non-core plugins should get automatically pulled along with core to any foundation.
<a name="l-342"></a><span class="tm">18:48:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> my primary concern in doing that is that it might drive corporate interests to the other side.

<a name="l-344"></a><span class="tm">18:48:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d_a_carver&gt;</span> magnayn, right, but you then have to manage a lot of IP related concerns yourself.
<a name="l-345"></a><span class="tm">18:48:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;domi_&gt;</span> I this realy an honest discussion about rejoining in any way with hudson or is it just a discusion because you feel it has to be held to be kind - I hoppe you are realy considering this to be a possibility
<a name="l-346"></a><span class="tm">18:48:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> I kind of like that approach too

<a name="l-352"></a><span class="tm">18:50:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d_a_carver&gt;</span> abayer, personally, I think both projects can survive on their own.

<a name="l-415"></a><span class="tm">18:57:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;billbillingsly&gt;</span> is there a list of specific concrete needs we're trying to meet?
<a name="l-416"></a><span class="tm">18:57:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> i.e., the existing code doesn't have to be relicensed, since MIT is compatible with ASL.

<a name="l-420"></a><span class="tm">18:58:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;larrys&gt;</span> there is apache extras where the plugins can live

<a name="l-423"></a><span class="tm">18:58:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d_a_carver&gt;</span> I guess the general thing for everybody to decide, does the jenkins project/committers views line up with the guidelines for an ASF project. http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html
<a name="l-424"></a><span class="tm">18:58:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zx&gt;</span> at Eclipse you can do EDL only (BSD) or dual license... and how you want to license the core versus the plug-ins are two different things
<a name="l-425"></a><span class="tm">18:58:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> I was thinking more eclipse - I can't for the life of me see how they can just relicense to EPL

<a name="l-434"></a><span class="tm">18:59:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kreyssel&gt;</span> but the "main" plugins should be on ASF
<a name="l-435"></a><span class="tm">18:59:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Yeah. Logistics for plug-ins would be tough regardless of EF or ASF, but I've got ideas on that front.

<a name="l-437"></a><span class="tm">18:59:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;d_a_carver&gt;</span> magnayn, then it can't be in the eclispe repositories, but it could be used as a third party dependency.

<a name="l-519"></a><span class="tm">19:11:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain_&gt;</span> 8am PT? That's hard for me. Usually in the middle of getting the kids out the door right then.

<a name="l-526"></a><span class="tm">19:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain_&gt;</span> Seems like coordinating a time that week is hard.
<a name="l-527"></a><span class="tm">19:12:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Kind of an important week, though.

<a name="l-532"></a><span class="tm">19:13:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> 24th is a lot better for me, as next day I can be wasted on airplane.
