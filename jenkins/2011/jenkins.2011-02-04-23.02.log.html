<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">23:02:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Ah, there we go.
<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">23:03:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So in what order do we want to do this?
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">23:03:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> So yeah, hi everyone. =) FYI, hare_brain is Dean Yu, the third member of the interim board.

<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">23:03:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tom_huybrechts&gt;</span> is there an agenda?
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">23:03:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I've been meaning to write up a wiki page proposal for Jenkins governance structure going forward - if you all would like, I can give a quick summary of what I've got so far.
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">23:04:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">proposal for Jenkins governance structure</span>
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">23:04:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tom_huybrechts:</span> Not exactly - first time I've done one of these things, so we're kinda faking it. =)
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">23:04:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tom_huybrechts&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> go for it :)
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">23:05:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> (BTW, see http://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot for the use of the bot)
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">23:05:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> So I think we need a more formal way of determining who gets to vote on the governance board, major changes to the project, etc - just having it be "anyone on the mailing lists" makes things, well, crazy.
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">23:05:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> +1
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">23:06:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> At a minimum, I think anyone who has committed to core or any plugins/extras/etc hosted in our Github org should have voting rights, and it makes sense to recognize the efforts of bug reporters, contributors to the wiki, etc as well.
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">23:06:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Those are three areas where we can definitely track who's done what and relate that to a jenkins-ci.org username.
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">23:07:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> In terms of automation, the only thing that's bit hard to automate is figuring out committer from git commit history.
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">23:07:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> It's e-mail address, whereas everything else now uses the same ID.
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">23:07:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I'd say if you've participated (with some definition of how much you have to do to count as participation) since the last election, you're eligible to vote in the next.
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">23:07:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> Ah, true. We can probably relate that to jenkins-ci.org users, though.
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">23:08:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">all:</span> is there any sort of contribution you think I'm missing that we should recognize for voting rights?
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">23:08:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mwalling&gt;</span> that sounds good, it can have a metric applied to it, etc
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">23:09:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rpetti&gt;</span> tech support on the mailing lists and irc, but that's kind of hard to track :/
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">23:09:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mwalling&gt;</span> i cant think of much else that can be measured easilly
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">23:09:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rpetti:</span> yeah. I'm hoping that the wiki/JIRA coverage will catch most of that.

<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">23:11:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tom_huybrechts&gt;</span> since we're on github now, what about people who fork and send pull request, but don't commit directly? not sure if there are many of those

<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">23:12:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lacostej&gt;</span> isn't it simpler to maintain a list of authorized people ? that list can be suggested by metrics or social requests, but I doubt it's possible to fully automate that ??
