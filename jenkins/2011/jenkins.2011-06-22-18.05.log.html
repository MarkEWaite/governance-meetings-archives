<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:15:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> thank you, aheritier
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:17:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">the LTS proposal from vjuranek is at http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/RFC-LTS-outlines-and-rules-td3605302.html</span>
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:18:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Shall we spend some time talking about it?
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:18:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier_&gt;</span> I see that some points are related to the ability to manage versions in Jira (ping rtyler)
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:19:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier_&gt;</span> Otherwise I think these are good practices but not all of them we'll be easy to automate/control
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:19:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Historically it's been hard to commit to the target release for a given issue.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:20:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> I agree
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:20:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Instead it was more of a train model.
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:20:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vjuranek&gt;</span> agree that it could be difficult... the proposal it rather "nice to have":-)
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:20:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And in 1.409.1, the fixes to it mainly came from the fixes we already had in the trunk.
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:20:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> it's easy to say on which version it will be solved when it is committed, but to say it before ...
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:21:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> For LTS it will always a set of fixes already in master versions
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:23:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> But aside from some of "nice to have" being hard to do, it all makes sense.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:23:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vjuranek&gt;</span> at least it would be nice to have some rules which fixes should be backpoted... not to backport randomly some fixes
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:23:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bap2000&gt;</span> As I understand, the LTS should only get major/critical fixes, so does it need a 1 month minor release schedule?
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:24:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Note that I believe JIRA marks all the issues as major by default.
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:25:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">bap2000:</span> to me, the idea is that we need some soak time before releasing it.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:25:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So I was originally thinking about the train model.
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:25:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> yes by default they are major and I don't think that many people change the level
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:26:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I always thought that default was weird. Can it be changed?
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:26:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> But I think the current thinking seems to be more like "release N days after fixes are backported"
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:26:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vjuranek&gt;</span> yes, in JIRA default is "major"...and therefore there are a lot of major issues
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:27:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So LTS isn't a train model, but more like "after N days of inactivity and no regression report"
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:27:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;bap2000&gt;</span> I think that core developers can assess and update the severity of issues
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:27:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#idea </span><span class="cmdline">shall we use blocker for that? If some of us think the bug is important enough, push it up to the blocker status?</span>
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:28:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And similarly, downgrade from blocker if needed.
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:28:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:28:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:28:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> IIUC, the point of vjuranek is to use some automated tracking mechanism for changes we want to back port.
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:28:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think it makes sense, and I think this is simple enough to get started.
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:28:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> if we had labels in jira, which i think we wanted for other reasons, we could just tag them as LTS
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:29:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vjuranek&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> well, I put some times as you discuss it on the last meeting, but in fact I like idea to put it first into release and "battle-tested"  it
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:29:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Right, I think we should still stick to the backporting model.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:29:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Agreed.
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:30:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I understand your proposal to use JIRA severity to collectively remember which ones we wanted to backport.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:30:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> precisely because there's going to be a delay till the fix gets battle-tested.
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:31:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jieryn:</span> label could work, too, but I think with severity we can expect angry users to help us triage.
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:31:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> labels are harder and only usable for those of us who know the convention.
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:31:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vjuranek&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> yes, that's the simplest scenario, but can be more comlicated - e.g. check JIRA for blockers and major issues &amp;&amp; git log for fixes which are already in the release
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:31:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> ok, that's a good point
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:31:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> +1 sev
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:32:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">vjuranek:</span> Yes, we can and should eventually automate those.
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:32:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;fredg02&gt;</span> will there be a separate changelog for the LTS releases?
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:32:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> ... like list up fixes to  blocker tickets in the master branch that's not in the stable branch.
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:32:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Those are back-porting candidates. Completely scriptable.
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:33:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think I like that.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:33:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#idea </span><span class="cmdline">I think vjuranek should capture his write up with this and put it to Wiki</span>
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:33:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> closed blocker tickets in the master and not in stable.
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:34:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:34:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;vjuranek&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> ok
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:34:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I was supposed to do a separate scripted daemon to update the ticket with the version that the fix is released in.
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:34:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I think there've been a couple of bug fixes that took a couple of commits, which happened to spread across weekly releases.
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:34:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> So we just need to make sure a fix is in its final form before backporting.
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:35:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think that can work both for master and stable, so people can see what releases the fix is in.
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:35:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> good point. I think so far we aren't thinking about automating backporting, so it should be easy to do.
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:36:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> (although come to think of it, automated backporting where we can would be kind of nice...)
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:36:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> but one step at a time.
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:36:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Hmm. I think I need to find some time to draw a diagram to illustrate some cases for myself. I think better in pictures. I'll share those if I can find time to create them.
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:36:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> thanks
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:37:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, anything else on this topic for now?
