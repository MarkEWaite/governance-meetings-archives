Meeting summary
---------------
* Plugin deprecations
  https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Proposed+Plugin+Deprecation
  (kohsuke, 18:02:31)
  * Ok, this one's my baby. We've got a bunch of plugins that do more or
    less the same thing, and that's causing confusion, duplication of
    effort, etc.  (abayer, 18:03:06)
  * IDEA: I propose we comb the plugin list to find possible
    duplications and when possible, deprecate older plugins in favor of
    newer ones providing the same functionality and possibly more.
    (abayer, 18:03:45)
  * e.g., the ones that prompted this - envfile and setenv have all
    their behavior incorporated into envinject.  (abayer, 18:04:16)
  * IIUC the migration implementation in envinject plugin is quite
    transparent and also backward compatible  (kohsuke, 18:07:32)
  * AGREED:   (rtyler, 18:09:06)
  * ACTION: abayer to write up his proposal for deprecated plugin
    behavior in the update center on the wiki  (abayer, 18:14:29)
  * IDEA: Review deprecation implementation ideas next meeting?
    (abayer, 18:16:28)
  * AGREED: Plugin deprecation is good. Implementation ideas are also
    good. Write 'em on the wiki, review 'em next week.  (abayer,
    18:17:33)

* Jenkins User Conference
  http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-user-conference  (kohsuke,
  18:19:48)
  * IDEA: If we have a bit of time, I'd love to hear what kind of talks
    people want to hear  (kohsuke, 18:20:43)

* olamy_ as owner on jenkinsci on github question  (kohsuke, 18:27:15)
  * IDEA: olamy_ should be added as an owner.  (abayer, 18:27:28)
  * AGREED:   (rtyler, 18:27:39)
  * AGREED: olamy's an owner....now!  (abayer, 18:32:08)

* Trademark Registration Status  (kohsuke, 18:33:11)
  * so the ball started rolling between SPI and us  (kohsuke, 18:33:28)

* Kohsuke wanted to discuss this (JENKINS-9488 - align topbar colors):
  https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/179  (kohsuke, 18:35:23)
  * so there's a pending request to change the color of the top bar of
    Jenkins UI  (kohsuke, 18:35:45)
  * one point I'd like to make is that the current color came from the
    same palette that's used for all the other icons  (kohsuke,
    18:36:41)
  * screenshot: http://postimage.org/image/2u9iq9v0k/  (kohsuke,
    18:44:02)

* : When is it time to release a new LTS release?  (kohsuke, 18:47:05)
  * ACTION: Kohsuke to run his script to identify tickets that are (1)
    marked as critical and (2) reported fixed in the trunk  (kohsuke,
    18:53:03)
  * AGREED: aiming 1.409.2 in 3-4 weeks, and then move to rebumping to
    1.42x after that.  (kohsuke, 19:02:24)

* next meeting time  (kohsuke, 19:02:41)
