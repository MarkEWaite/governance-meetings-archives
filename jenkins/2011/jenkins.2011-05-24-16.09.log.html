<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">16:09:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> let's try to do it quickly

<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">16:11:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> I guess then there's no one around who had action items assigned
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">16:11:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yeah
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">16:12:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> except:
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">16:12:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> Kohsuke to update a Wiki page to encourage l10n to be pushed directlyKohsuke to also write a note that l10n contributiors sshouldn't unilatelarly release a new version
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">16:12:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And for me, things with my name are still TBD.
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">16:12:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> ah
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">16:12:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So let's skip right to the real meat
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">16:12:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">umbrella foundation / reconcilation requirements</span>
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">16:12:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> One quick report from me is that ...
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">16:13:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> SPI board has formally voted on the resolution to accept us and it was approved
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">16:13:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> cool
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">16:13:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> coool
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">16:13:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> clap clap
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">16:13:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So we have an open invitation there, which expires in 45 days or so.
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">16:13:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> applause
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">16:13:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So we got one clock ticking on that front. I think it should be plenty of time.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">16:14:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> nothing from the other organizations, yet?
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">16:14:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">SFC I don't think I've heard from specifically.</span>
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">16:14:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> Do we always want to study challengers ? like ASF &amp; co ?
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">16:15:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> +1 to continue study others (asf)
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">16:15:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I can ping them back, but in my mind SPI and SFC are so similar in their nature.
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">16:15:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes, we should still consider other options.
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">16:15:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">16:15:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> SPI/SFC look good to me
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">16:16:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> magnayn what is your issue with asf ?
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">16:16:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> It might be easier to talk about reconcilation process first
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">16:16:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think that's the one with the most early dead line.
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">16:16:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">olamy:</span> Infrastructure baggage, mainly - unless that can be circumvented
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">16:17:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> infra you mean what ? (git ? )
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">16:17:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">If we are to send some comments to Eclipse proposal process, I believe we need to do so in a few days.</span>
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">16:17:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">olamy:</span> git, yes; I worry about the politicking I hear of Apache Infra.
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">16:18:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I've just seen https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2011/05/23/the-eclipse-hudson-proposal/ and it made me even more pessimistic about making that work, though.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">16:18:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span>  I agree
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">16:18:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> kohsuke agree too
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">16:18:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> I'm -1 on eclipse anyway...
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">16:18:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> sorry
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">16:19:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> magnayn btw git support @asf for canonical repo is really on study by infra folks
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">16:19:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> lateness
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">16:19:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> I think ASF will be too heavy for Jenkins thus Eclipse it will be worst
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">16:19:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> It may kill the community I think
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">16:19:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tofuatjava&gt;</span> hi, what's the problem with eclipse fondation
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">16:19:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">olamy:</span> Fine - but to me that's cart before horse. Infra should not be dictating to projects what they can and cannot use...
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">16:20:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> and it was always the case (jira, confluence ...)
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">16:20:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> aheritier : but here we talk about moving core and maybe bundled plugins
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">16:20:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> so not a too big community of dev folks
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">16:20:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> <span class="hi">olamy:</span> yes but you think that we'll be able like oracle to replace all non compatible deps @ co ?
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">16:20:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> in fact they started to move everything out of core because of that
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">16:21:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">16:21:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> at the end I'm sure they'll just move a class with a main()
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">16:21:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">16:21:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#save</span><span class="cmdline"></span>
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">16:22:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> The core team is reduced (which is good thing to keep the control and ensure the stability) but they won't be able to do that with a stable and evolutions and ...
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">16:22:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> I don't know perhaps they are supermen ...
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">16:22:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I think options that fracture core/plugin community are less than ideal
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">16:22:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> yeah, agree
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">16:23:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> agree
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">16:23:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> I'd like to stay core on Github, too
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">16:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> I agree. It's my problem too with moving only core to ASF
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">16:23:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> rtyler true that's could be a problem
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">16:23:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> IMO infrastructure is fine at the moment
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">16:24:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> As I put on the wiki page, that's my problem with ASF - 'canonical repository' is a stupid term when we use a DVCS
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">16:24:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> If we get some orga for the legal part, that would be enough
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">16:24:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> btw my main concern is more to move in a place where we don't have to handle infras (jira, confluence etc..) and concentrate on code
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">16:24:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I think it's worth putting this into the log

<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">16:27:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">olamy:</span> it has all the pros of SFC
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">16:28:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> IIRC SPI / SFC are similar - basically equivalent to a non-profit without the effort
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">16:28:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> k
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">16:28:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> they're similar, yes, SFC is a bit higher profile
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">16:28:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> SPi has both OpenOffice and LibreOffice... :-)
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">16:29:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> arf fun to see jenkins with such good friends :-)
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">16:30:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> The only reason I can see to pick anything else is if it's actively desired to hand over the infrastructure..
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">16:30:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I wonder if ASF could be willing to compromise on just about all their cons :P
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">16:31:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> there is no compromise with ASF :-)
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">16:31:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> Well, even if they could, I'm left wondering 'what is the benefit' ?
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">16:31:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> well
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">16:31:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> let's get this out of the way
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">16:31:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">We have not applied or made *any* ASF proposals thus far</span>
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">16:32:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think the benefit of ASF is that it creates the kind of stability that helps users feel comfortable.
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">16:32:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> IMHO there's a big benefit in moving to ASF in that they are the ASF which has a lot of mindshare (whether or not that's deserved)
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">16:32:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> yeah, what he said :P
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">16:32:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banoss&gt;</span> hi!
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">16:32:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> kohsuke +1
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">16:32:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> My impression is that's less true today than it was, say, 5 years ago..
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">16:32:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> as far as I can tell, nobody is honestly considering Eclipse
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">16:32:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> which leaves SPI, SFC and ASF
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">16:33:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> IMHO we should make a formal proposal and at least see if they even want us :P
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">16:33:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> and by we
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">16:33:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I mean abayer
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">16:33:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> xD
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">16:33:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> you are talking about ASF ? The incubator process is long. And if it takes more than 45 days ?
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">16:33:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> btw the incubation process @asf will be some similar to the eclipse one
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">16:34:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;SaschaV&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> I wouldn't say nobody, but probably nobody that counts ;)
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">16:34:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> ASF just seems like a waterfall entity in an agile world
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">16:34:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">aheritier:</span> have you taken a prject trhough the incubator
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">16:34:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> I agree to some extent
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">16:35:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> I followed some but I never participated directly.
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">16:35:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> Has anyone already considered: what if we decide for - say SPI - and in 1 year we want to re-unite with Hudson
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">16:35:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> Would there be a way to get out of SPI to Eclipse?
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">16:35:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> IMHO agile process is made by the community not by the umbrella

<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">16:35:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> okay
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">16:35:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kutzi:</span> that said, I don't see that ever happening
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">16:35:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kutzi:</span> yes, a project can withdraw from SPI.
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">16:35:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">olamy:</span> but if the umbrella places technical obstacles, it stops the agility
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">16:36:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> you know what we could try
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">16:36:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> we could try a week or two of the "ASF way" as an experiment
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">16:36:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> and if everybody completely fucking hates it

<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">16:36:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> then that crosses them off the list, easy as pie :)

<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">16:37:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> So that means shutting github for a week and setting up SVN ? :-/
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">16:37:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I mean with regards to the release process and new committer access
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">16:37:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> the SVN thing is completely nuts :P
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">16:38:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> afaik abayer is working with dcutting so he probably can to have more infos (regarding the git support)
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">16:38:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think I agree that ASF introduces some technical obstacles, ranging from Git/SVN to LGPL, core/plugin split to votes. The question in my mind if it's worth the price of improving our standing in the eyes of users
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">16:38:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> IMO, the stable branch will do more for users than stickerware
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">16:39:01 </span><span class="nka">* rtyler</span> <span class="ac">nods</span>
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">16:39:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Maybe I'm overly concerned about the Hudson Eclipse move, but it seems like a safer move.
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">16:39:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">16:39:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> here's my pep talk regarding that
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">16:39:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> we shouldn't care about that honestly
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">16:40:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> (I still wonder if hudson will ever make it into Eclipse if they want EPL)
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">16:40:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> users are nice, but IMHO what's made Jenkins great has been developers creating the tools that they like in an atmosphere they like
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">16:40:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> Jenkins doesn't have to crush Hudson to continue to be successful
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">16:40:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tofuatjava&gt;</span> can anyone ecplain me what's the problem with eclipse in one or two sentence? i don't understand the problem...
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">16:40:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tofuatjava:</span> https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Possible+Jenkins+Umbrella+Foundations
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">16:41:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> yeah, I agree with that argument
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">16:41:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> Hudson has a number of contributors that are outsourced for crying out loud
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">16:41:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> Jenkins has a number of happy volunteers working on it in their free time
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">16:41:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tofuatjava:</span> Prime example: git plugin uses a patched jgit. JGit is @ eclipse, and noone can be bothered to babysit the patches through that process.
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">16:41:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I think magnayn is right that a stable branch will do far more to shore up the "enterprise/slow moving" users
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">16:42:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> do you know when the next SFC board meeting is off the top of your head?
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">16:42:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> No, I don't know. Why?
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">16:42:29 </span><span class="nka">* rtyler</span> <span class="ac">is trying to move this discussion along</span>
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">16:43:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I think at this point any org that imposes process on top of the community and there *will* be contributor churn
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">16:43:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> Also, we can build credibility (if that's your worry) by listing the companies that use Jenkins on the website
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">16:43:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> that's on my todo
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">16:43:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I know abayer and a number of folks are passionate about the ASF
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">16:43:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> and by publishing statics of usage from update site and co
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">16:44:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> One of the things I like about SPI is that it doesn't close any doors down the road.
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">16:44:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> If we go with SPI and later started feeling that we need to be with ASF, we can do that.
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">16:44:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> (the other way around is not the case)
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">16:44:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> that's an interesting idea
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">16:45:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> what if you, abayer, hare_brain said "we're going to go ahead and go with SPI, but continue talking with ASF"
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">16:45:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> think that'd piss off SPI?
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">16:45:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I don't think so, as long as we genuinely believe that SPI is right choice for us right now.
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">16:45:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> +1 Let's go to SPI and continue to talk with ASF if one day ...
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">16:46:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> Is there any substantive difference between SPI and SFC ?
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">16:46:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> any thoughts?
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">16:46:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banoss&gt;</span> It sounds non-commital. Will that keep folks wondering and affect contributions?
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">16:46:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;knorrium&gt;</span> I have an end user and recent dev point of view to share. I was using Hudson until Jenkins came out. I wanted to contribute to the project with translations so I just went to github and forked the repo. It was pretty easy and straightforward. I don't think that should change with an unbrella foundation backing the project up.
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">16:47:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;knorrium&gt;</span> so from what I understood after reading that link, any change in the repo might be a headache to new contributors
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">16:47:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">banoss:</span> yeah. that's a point.
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">16:47:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">knorrium:</span> indeed, that workflow has made Jenkins fantastic
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">16:47:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> kohsuke I like the idea too  (when asf will have git we will be able to move :-) )
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">16:47:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">knorrium:</span> I think we care a lot about keeping the barrier of entry low.
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">16:47:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> that's the low barrier to entry at work
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">16:48:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> the success of Jenkisn isn't in the product itself in term of quality (even if it is better day after day) but in its community and the large set of plugins. This is something that no other CI server has
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">16:48:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> Joined in the middle, so still trying to catch up to the conversation.
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">16:48:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> I think we should reach out to SFC and see what their timeline is
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">16:48:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> but SPI is happy to have us, and we need to stop focusing on this shit for a while
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">16:48:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> and get back to Jenkins :)
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">16:49:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> time line for what? answering their invitation?
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">16:49:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I see no problem with the SPI, it keeps the status quo with some legal help
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">16:49:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> +1 for SPI now, if that leaves the door open for other possibilities later
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">16:49:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tofuatjava&gt;</span> but shareing git with svn is running fine for me, because i prefare to use a tool where i'm good in (maybe i will be good in git too, some time) so something like that can be driven anywhere, or not?
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">16:49:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> SFC I thought they hadn't even talked about Jenkins at a board meeting yet
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">16:49:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Oh, SFC.
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">16:50:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Right.
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">16:50:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> Does SFC have any difference to SPI (other than which projects they host) ?
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">16:50:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I don't want to say bad things about SFC because it's making the world better, but I worry a bit about the pace in which they move.
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">16:51:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> There has been delays after delays.
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">16:51:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> SFC hasn't accepted us :P
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">16:51:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> In contrast, SPI moved very fast.
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">16:51:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> ok thus let's move to SPI
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">16:51:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">16:51:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">16:51:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> But yes, we can definitely ping them back.
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">16:51:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> If there's no substantive difference then why bother with SFC ?
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">16:51:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> seems like a perfect fir for Jenkins. we're fast, too :)
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">16:51:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> fit
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">16:52:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> +1 for SPI
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">16:53:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> I don't htink we've ever had something we really needed the interim board to vote on :)
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">16:53:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> +1 for SPI if there's no particular advantage to SFC..
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">16:53:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, I think I'm seeing the consensus emerging...
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">16:54:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> from the folks in the meeting, yes
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">16:54:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I suppose another +1 for SPI is that it's very close to the original vote that formed Jenkins.
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">16:54:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> what do you mean?
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">16:54:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> +1 but we can keep in mind ASF for latter :P
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">16:54:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> <span class="hi">olamy:</span> I think if we're voting to go to SPI, it should be with the intention to stay there.
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">16:55:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;banoss&gt;</span> Is it at all a credibility concern?
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">16:55:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> yes.
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">16:55:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tofuatjava&gt;</span> I also thin ki t would be good to be in touch with ASF
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">16:55:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> hare_brain : k
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">16:55:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tofuatjava:</span> abayer works in the same office with many ASF committers and at least one board memeber :P
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">16:56:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think it'd be prudent to ask to meet with Doug Cutting with abayer's help once more to get more authoritative stories on the points raised.
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">16:56:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Was there a discussion about whether choosing one foundation over another would mean that certain people who are currently contributing would stop?
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">16:56:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> when's the next time you're in the country kohsuke  :)
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">16:57:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Right now one -1 for ASF that worries me is that we can't use LGPL.
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">16:57:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> It has a lot of negative impacts on compatibility and functionalities.
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">16:57:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> yes it is ASL no choice

<a name="l-299"></a><span class="tm">17:09:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> - test-harness takes like forever to run (~1 hour for me)

<a name="l-306"></a><span class="tm">17:11:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> but the error message you cite is from Maven
<a name="l-307"></a><span class="tm">17:11:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> kohsuke, maybe. The point is that it's broken locally while succeeding on J-o-J
<a name="l-308"></a><span class="tm">17:11:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK.
<a name="l-309"></a><span class="tm">17:11:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> And I've got no clue what's wrong on my side
<a name="l-310"></a><span class="tm">17:11:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> Last time I tried to diagnose, I noticed it was using a junit-plugin... is surefire now fixed enough to move back to that ?
<a name="l-311"></a><span class="tm">17:12:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> yes, I'd propose using standard plugins
<a name="l-312"></a><span class="tm">17:12:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> sconnoly was saying that it will be soon.
<a name="l-313"></a><span class="tm">17:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> surefire has now concurrency, too
<a name="l-314"></a><span class="tm">17:12:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> concurrency via multiple VMs?
<a name="l-315"></a><span class="tm">17:12:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> I began a branch with some maven build cleanup
<a name="l-316"></a><span class="tm">17:12:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> there is a lot of things to do :-)
<a name="l-317"></a><span class="tm">17:12:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> johsuke You, can fork per test if you mean that
<a name="l-318"></a><span class="tm">17:13:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kutzi:</span> no.
<a name="l-319"></a><span class="tm">17:13:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> btw last surefire version works very better
<a name="l-320"></a><span class="tm">17:13:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> with concurrency supported too
<a name="l-321"></a><span class="tm">17:13:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> The current junit plugin forks say 3 VMs first, then create a single worker queue from which all 3 VMs pull tests from.
<a name="l-322"></a><span class="tm">17:13:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So you won't incur the per-test fork overhead, but it still fully isolates concurrent executions.
<a name="l-323"></a><span class="tm">17:14:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> I don't know for sure, but I guess surefire can't do that
<a name="l-324"></a><span class="tm">17:14:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;drulli&gt;</span> Did someone look into the changes in the Oracle Hudson release? They claimed to fix some testing problems. Maybe there is something we can copy/use?

<a name="l-326"></a><span class="tm">17:14:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> But according to our Maven experts in the Jenkins project, it'll be added to surefire soon, if not already

<a name="l-330"></a><span class="tm">17:15:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think some plugins do more mock-oriented tests. Should we encourage that more?
<a name="l-331"></a><span class="tm">17:15:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kutzi&gt;</span> yes absolutely!
<a name="l-332"></a><span class="tm">17:15:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> That has some obvious benefits that address kutzi's concerns.
<a name="l-333"></a><span class="tm">17:15:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;aheritier&gt;</span> As tests are failing on the master I cannot validate my changes
