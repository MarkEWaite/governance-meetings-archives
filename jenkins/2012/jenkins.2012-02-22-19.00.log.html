<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:08:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> This one's pretty much all you, rtyler. =)
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:08:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> this is my schtick, let me enumerate the pross and cons
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:09:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> Drupal is great, but I think we could greatly benefit by a more simple statically generated site that we can manage with our typical GitHub infrastructure
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> this will allow more authors and more content to be more easily published
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:09:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Easy is always good.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:09:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I've done a couple Drupal -&gt; Jekyll conversions and it's pretty straight-forward
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:09:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I would honestly rather go this route, than figuring out a good ACL scheme for Drupal with our LDAP
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:10:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I can spend the time to get a working dump "online" without affecting normal operations
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:10:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Works for me - but admittedly, I defer to you on all thing site-ish.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:10:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> right, I want to change that up a little more ;)
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:10:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> This is not for the wiki, but for jenkins-ci.org itself?
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:10:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> www, yes
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:10:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> this would also make things like ndeloof's logo action item a simple pull request by somebody that is not me
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:10:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:10:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> How would the changelogs and releases get updated?
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:11:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> that's some simple PHP garbage on the host anyways
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:11:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> we can still run that, it'd have to likely stay out of the tree I htink
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:12:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Or we could set up a job to update static pages with the changelog/releases stuff, I'd imagine.
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:12:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">need to be mindful of how changelogs are generated and sourced in the current site</span>
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:12:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> sounds like a good plan
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:12:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> nobody's screamed in terror, so I think i'll start tinkering with it and see what I can come up with
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:12:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Definitely worth pursuing at the very least.

<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:15:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I'm the one who proposed the eligibility criteria for the rename vote last year, but that was ad hoc - just looking at the members list of the mailing lists as of a point in time.
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:15:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> But I'm not sure whether that's really viable at this point.

We are really pumped to have 4 JUC conferences to organize this year! But we need your help in a big way. To ensure the conferences are successful, we need the Community to be very involved and to really make them *Jenkins* conferences, rather than a conference CloudBees is organizing. That is what we’d like to discuss today.

<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">19:25:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Drumming up presenters was a large effort.

Get people to register to attend (Early Bird pricing in effect right now, too), get organizations to sponsor and have people apply to speak. This could be a mixture of blogging, posting in Jenkins forums, emailing the Jenkins list, Tweeting, Facebooking – and getting o

<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">19:27:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I think one key aspect would be to reach out to folks incorporated with local JUGs near the JUC

<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">19:30:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> that's all the ideas I've really had around it
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:30:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> having people more local to the JUC will be mots beneficial from the grassroots perspective

<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:30:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;alyssa_&gt;</span> but it's still not enough to generate registrations and speaker and sponsors

<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:31:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;heidig&gt;</span> Agreed with Alyssa. What else might make sense for the Community to do? Are there Jenkins users who are particularly well-connected and could really ramp up visibiilty within the Community?

<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">19:40:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> We have people who hang out here on IRC a lot.
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">19:41:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> There are the people who interact on the mailing lists
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">19:41:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Those are the people that are easy to reach.

<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">19:43:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> The metaquestion is how are you guys defining community? Yahoo is a company of thousands and we use Jenkins, but I wouldnt' categorize all of them as being part of the community.
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">19:44:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;heidig&gt;</span> Community = Jenkins users. Period. Wherever they are.

<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">19:48:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;heidig&gt;</span> Right. We just don't know who they all are - even the engaged ones - to ask them to step up the noise. That's where we need help from the Community - to do the asking.
