Meeting summary
---------------
* https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda
  (kohsuke, 19:01:29)
* name grant request take 2  (kohsuke, 19:01:55)
  * in the previous meeting I've asked for "Jenkins Multi-master by
    CloudBees" and that subsequently got approved  (kohsuke, 19:02:37)

* LTS status  (kohsuke, 19:07:06)
  * ACTION: kohsuke to produce 1.532.1 RC today  (kohsuke, 19:08:07)
  * ACTION: ogondza to create 1.532.x testing page in Wiki  (kohsuke,
    19:12:56)
  * AGREED: we'll aim for a release in a week  (kohsuke, 19:22:10)
  * ACTION: kohsuke to look at selenium-tests and try to help maintain
    it  (kohsuke, 19:22:31)
  * ACTION: kohsuke to make sure https://jenkins-ci.org/stable-rc shows
    the RC version number  (kohsuke, 19:24:09)
  * ACTION: kohsuke to make sure https://jenkins-ci.org/changelog-stable
    shows 1.532.1 changes after posting RC  (kohsuke, 19:25:28)

* commit loss status updates  (kohsuke, 19:25:57)
  * so in case people haven't been paying attention to the dev list, on
    Saturday an accident resulted in the effective "git push -f" on a
    large number of repositories in the jenkinsci org  (kohsuke,
    19:26:43)
  * ... resulting in us losing about a month worth of commits in various
    branches  (kohsuke, 19:27:20)
  * GitHub support helped us recover a large number of it, although
    exactly how they identify what commits, we don't know  (kohsuke,
    19:27:55)
  * and I wrote a program that reconstructs what commits were lost from
    GitHub API and resurrected the rest of the commits that GitHub
    support missed  (kohsuke, 19:28:33)
  * At this moment we consider all commits recovered in all the branches
    in all the repositories  (kohsuke, 19:29:01)
  * but your checking sanity on this claim by looking at your
    repositories would be greatly appreciated  (kohsuke, 19:29:21)
  * we'll write up something and post it on http://jenkins-ci.org/node
    (kohsuke, 19:30:52)

* next meeting  (kohsuke, 19:34:49)
  * AGREED: next meeting is Dec 11th  (kohsuke, 19:36:58)

Meeting ended at 19:37:11 UTC.
