<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:03:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Slide-O-Mix&gt;</span> bundled plugins can be annoying
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:04:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Or generally guide users better to the plugins we estimate they need/.
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:04:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> one of the important goals for me is not to leave new users clueless as to how to achieve typical things
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:04:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Slide-O-Mix&gt;</span> perhaps there could be a plugin pack (or more than one) for different use cases
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:04:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ctc&gt;</span> sorry to butt in, but as a first time Jenkins user some time last week, who needed to use CVS 1.6 because of a need for :sspi:, I found it very easy to find out how to download the old version and pin it.  2 cents, butting out
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:06:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Slide-O-Mix:</span> “pack” can take different forms. A simple list of plugins to install in batch during setup; or an actual plugin depending on others (updates to which might actually pull in new plugins).
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:06:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> The latter being more like a metapackage in Debian etc.
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:06:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> put another way, I feel like it needs to be bit more like IntelliJ, which comes with more stuff out of the box, than Eclipse, where the first thing you do after launching is to install more plugins
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:06:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Slide-O-Mix&gt;</span> yeah, I was thinking more like a metapackage
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:06:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I dislike the Eclipse model.
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:06:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Slide-O-Mix&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> maybe have different releases then, because I think there are a large number of people that wouldn't like having more bundled plugins
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:07:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#chair </span><span class="cmdline">hare_brain</span>
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:07:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;robobutler&gt;</span> Current chairs: hare_brain kohsuke rtyler
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:07:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Slide-O-Mix&gt;</span> a bare release with no bundled plugins, and then other releases (Git Release, SVN Release, or something)
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:07:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Slide-O-Mix:</span> yes, it looks like there are strong voices not wanting to see more bundled stuff
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:07:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kpfleming&gt;</span> i'll add my voice to that list, for what it's worth. i have nearly all the bundled plugins disabled.
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:08:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> What is wrong with shipping a bare release, and then making it convenient to add high-level bundles from UC once started?
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:08:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Or a real installer that asks you what you want, and goes and fetches plugins for you.
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:08:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> But I also don't like "here's 7 different download packages (times 5 different platforms) you can choose from" Eclipse model
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:08:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Agreed, -1 on a proliferation of downloads.
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:08:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> There should be one jenkins.war.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:08:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Slide-O-Mix&gt;</span> with nothing bundled ;)
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:09:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jglick:</span> this appeared to be where JENKINS-9598 conversation is heading to indeed &gt;&gt; "shipping a bare release, and then making it convenient to add high-level bundles from UC once started?"
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:09:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jenkins-admin&gt;</span> JENKINS-9598:Bundle Git plugin, or overhaul bundled plugins or setup experience (Open) http://jenkins-ci.org/issue/9598
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:09:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kpfleming:</span> I think we all agree that what we bundle needs to be revisited
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:10:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> (the reason we bundle what we bundle is mostly for backward compatibility, not because we think majority of users need CVS)
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:10:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kpfleming&gt;</span> Sure, that's what I figured.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:10:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Then why subversion-plugin?
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:10:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> subversion also used to be in the core
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:12:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Looks like I definitely need to get a thread started.
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:12:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> This really is something a lot of people seem to have opinions about
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:12:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> We could have a special list in core of config.xml patterns indicating implicit usage of plugins that were split out of core.
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:12:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jglick:</span> I'm not sure how that would help?
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:13:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> So that if you start a new jenkins.war download on an existing $JENKINS_HOME you will not be left with broken data.
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:13:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> But we can then cease to bundle cvs.hpi, subversion.hpi, etc.
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:13:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> but isn't that a chicken &amp; egg problem? By the time we are loading data, we've already started plugins?
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:13:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Reload Configuration in that case.
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:14:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Rare anyway.
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:14:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> or I guess we can bundle them but not activate them until we see them used
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:14:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Actually probably not even necessary to worry about it, since if you had an old $JENKINS_HOME you would also have had plugins/cvs.jpi etc. there too.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:15:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> I.e. unbundling plugins only has any effect on brand-new installations.
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:15:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> no you don't, that's the whole point
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:15:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> for example up until 1.467 LDAP support was in jenkins-core.jar
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:15:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> so if you are upgrading from 1.424 to the current release then you won't have plugins/ldap.jpi
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:16:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Yeah but few people will upgrade in such a big leap without going through an intermediate release.
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:16:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> If you want to provide for those who do then we can use the hardcoded compatibility list I mentioned.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:16:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Slide-O-Mix&gt;</span> Those are the ones that cause problems though
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:16:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Slide-O-Mix&gt;</span> someone upgrading from 1.3xx to 1.522 :)
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:17:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Similar to what we already have in the plugin system for adding implicit plugin → plugin dependencies when a plugin depends on an older core.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:17:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I sense OSGI rearing its ugly head… :p
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:18:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> At any rate, I think the compatibility is a relatively minor technical point, if there is broad agreement that we want to avoid stuffing things into jenkins.war.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:19:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Still leaves open the question of how to guide new users toward installing popular, stable plugins that they do not yet know they need.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:19:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> As I said, I'm actually for stuffing more into jenkins.war.
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:19:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> What is the advantage over using the update center?
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:20:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> The disadvantage is clear: big, unwieldy distribution files.
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:20:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonnyro&gt;</span> Backwards compatibility is overrated
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:20:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Slide-O-Mix&gt;</span> I've had to increase the allowed upload size in Tomcat three times recently because jenkins.war is getting so big
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:20:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jonnyro&gt;</span> I'd rather know exactly what I am getting
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:20:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> A part of it is that it creates a common combination of plugin versions
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:20:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Makes it easier to focus our precious QA resources
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:21:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> QA can test a predetermined combination of plugins whether they are physically bundled or not.
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:21:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kpfleming&gt;</span> Does it really though? If a user installs a new Jenkins, they'll likely update all the bundled plugins right away anyway.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:21:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Slide-O-Mix&gt;</span> just have a list of recommended plugin versions for that version of Jenkins
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:21:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Slide-O-Mix&gt;</span> the "core" set of plugins that _used_ to be bundled with core
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:21:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Another way to look at this is that jenkins.war is both what is built, and what is distributed. The two don't have to be the same. For example, what if there was a service that create a jenkins.war-as-a-distribution on the fly, based on a user's choice of plugins?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:21:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kpfleming&gt;</span> <span class="hi">Slide-O-Mix:</span> be careful... that discussion could lead to plugin branches :-)
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:22:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> I think the “recommended plugin version” should always be “latest”.
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:22:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> That is distinct from building a stripped down jenkins.war that is an input into that.
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:23:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> BTW someone built just that: http://code.google.com/p/jenkins-assembler/
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:23:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Well, there you go. :)
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:23:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Work complete.
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:24:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> But to me, the motivation is to steer a significant number of users into using largely the same combination, so giving everyone the option of creating their own made-to-order jenkins.war isn't helping at all
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:24:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Right. The value we can add is the information.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:25:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Producing a custom jenkins.war seems pretty pointless anyway when you just start a minimal WAR and use the UC.
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:26:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kpfleming&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> if you have just one combination you'd like new users to start with, could you create a 'Starter Pack' plugin that depends on all the other plugins you'd like them to have, and have the UI prompt them to install it if there are no other plugins installed?
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:26:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I think the point is making that experience easier. Someone coming to Jenkins for the first time, and giving them a bare war, and sending them to UC would be a pretty intimidating experience, I think.
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:27:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kpfleming:</span> that is the “metapackage” discussed above, if you have just one.
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:27:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kpfleming&gt;</span> right, ok.
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:27:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kpfleming:</span> right, I think something like that building on top of more visible meta-packages.
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:27:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> the full change would of course have to include offering a simplified view of the UC and showing it immediately after start, as a setup wizard.
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:27:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> and if we give the meta packages more visibility in the first landing screen upon boot, instead of the regular update center, I think that'd be easy enough user experience
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:28:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> exactly
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:28:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Another thing to consider is that perhaps talking about plugin combinations is too low level for users. What they care about most is, "I have this specific workflow. What do I need to make Jenkins do that for me?"
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:28:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Still not convinced that a metapackage is what we want, as opposed to a simple set of lists.
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:29:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> A metapackage is a plugin that remains installed, which has various effects on the UC UI thereafter: for example, if you turn off one of the implied plugins, you are forced to turn off the metapackage too.
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:29:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> This is intuitive enough when all plugins offer real functionality, but less intuitive when some are just placeholders.
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:29:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jglick:</span> that's true. at the implementation level I'm not too hang up on the meta package
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">18:30:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Ubuntu does it, but I am not sure how it works technically when you work with the Software Center as opposed to low-level apt-get.
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">18:30:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> NetBeans also does it, but at the expense of rather complicated semantics that took a long time to hammer out (and are probably still not quite right).
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">18:30:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> aside from the "starter pack" and then Java/PHP/Ruby/Android/iOS pack, I'm not sure what will emerge
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">18:31:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> The alternative is a set of labeled lists of artifactId’s to be installed during startup and forgotten thereafter.
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">18:31:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> definitely SCMs need to be picked here topo
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">18:31:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> too
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">18:31:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Take a look through the user mailing list at the questions of the form "How do I make Jenkins do X?"
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">18:32:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:32:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Would advertising features without installing it help?
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">18:33:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> from my experience I can say that this gets crazy very quickly
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">18:33:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think Microsoft used to do that --- you can install just the start-up icons, or even some menu items in Office, and it launches the Windows setup to install some additional components before it delivers what you asked for
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">18:33:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Perhaps. I don't remember seeing in the current Office, so maybe they decided that it was a bad idea
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">18:34:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> NetBeans does it and it is living hell to keep the system working.
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">18:35:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kpfleming&gt;</span> Knowing that quite a few Jenkins installations don't have direct access to the Internet would make that a concern in my mind.
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:35:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Shall we move on to the next topic?
