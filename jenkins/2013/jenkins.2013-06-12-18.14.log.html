<a name="l-3"></a><span class="tm">18:14:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> oh hey, there it is
<a name="l-4"></a><span class="tm">18:14:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> oh I don't have to have '@' to do that
<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">18:14:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gjoseph&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rpetti:</span> kohsuke: i'm getting there. complete URL coming up:) Thanks !
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">18:15:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">"Jenkins certification" from Tokyo</span>
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">18:15:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">https://docs.google.com/file/d/18sXYsZJrvkSECZKYfxLFkyDKlnlQTCvpaigY9BW_PTX4pJeEWu2iJyBBQ90S/edit</span>
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">18:15:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I was asked from my Jenkins friends in Tokyo to present this on their behalf becaue they are sound asleep
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">18:16:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> SHIFT is one of the companies that's promoting Jenkins in Japan,
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">18:16:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> and as a way of propping up adoption/interest or promoting Jenkins users, they came up with this certification idea
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">18:17:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> it's a bit hard to say "yeah, totally" to something which doesn't seem to have been completed
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">18:17:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> this deck looks good to me though
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:17:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> The idea is that this makes it something you can put on your resume, or make this skill something worthwhiel
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:17:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> the split on basic vs. expert is a good one too
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:17:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Other people in Japanese Jenkins community are OK with this
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:18:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And even though this is only written in English they aren't interested in doing it outside Japan so far
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:18:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> do you know what the licensing arrangement might be for the exam or materials?
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:19:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> i.e. if our friends at Pragwhatever in denmark wanted to help facilitate Jenkins cert. there
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:19:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;[diecast]&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> what is Tokyo Tyrant
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:20:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> we currently have CloudBees, Praqma, SHIFT, and a few others who I forget concerned with Jenkins
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:20:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> so they do intend this to be the community thing
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:20:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I think if SHIFT is willing to develop something, and we say "yes, you can call it a Jenkins Certification" then some allowances for other companies in other markets to license it should be made
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:21:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> and I talked to them that that's actually works better for them, too, and they agree.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:21:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> sounds good to me then
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:21:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> What they told me is that they don't want to lose money, and writing exam and materials do cost
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:21:35 </span><span class="nka">* rtyler</span> <span class="ac">nods</span>
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:21:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So I thought it'd be perfectly fair that they charge the "exam fee" to cover that cost
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:22:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So in principle I don't think they have problems with other countries reusing the materials
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:22:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> It's more up to us what we think how it should be
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:22:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I'm not suggesting they need to offer it for free, but "reasonably priced" or something like that would be good
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:23:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> one way to ensure that is that we commission the work to SHIFT
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:23:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> we as in the project
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:24:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> but that costs us upfront, I guess
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:25:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> eep
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:26:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I'll probably just ask them and CC the mailing list
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:27:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> more concretely they are seeking the permission to use the name "Jenkins" for this purpose
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:27:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> I take it that you feel OK with it
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:27:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Anyone else has any thoughts on this?
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:27:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I think it's reasonable
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:28:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think making Jenkins skills marketable is good for us
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:29:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> All right, I think that's good enough for now given the attendance
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:29:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">next meeting</span>
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:30:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> The next meeting will be in two weeks, as usual
