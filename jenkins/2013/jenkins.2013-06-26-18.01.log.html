<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">18:02:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Really the only thing I wanted to ask was to sponsor someone to come to JUC Palo Alto
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">18:02:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I believe the last conversation on the travel grant is that there's reasonable willingness in the community, and we'd try to raise some money for it
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">18:03:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I haven't tallied the exact figure, but I think we have $1000 or so
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">18:04:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ct_&gt;</span> Is it possible to use sspi with Jenkins CVS?
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">18:04:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ct_&gt;</span> I'm getting errors, and have seen other people ask about it but not get answers
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">18:04:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">ct_:</span> let's come back to the usual tech Q&amp;A until after the project meeting
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:05:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ct_&gt;</span> oh, didn't realize there was a project meeting going on, sorry
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:05:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> if we are to sponsor someone to travel, it's either this, FOSDEM, or Copenhagen event, I think
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:05:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I mean JUC Palo Alto by "this"
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:06:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Do you have someone in mind to travel, and what would be expected from the person in return for the sponsorship?
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:06:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I talked to orrc in Munich and he was interested
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:07:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Or maybe imod can be made convinced?
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:07:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> wrt "what's expected" ...
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:08:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I'm not sure. Presenting in JUC and attending the dev event?
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:09:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">this is how OpenBSD does it: http://forums.freebsd.org/showthread.php?t=38573</span>
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:10:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> reading
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:11:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Aside from the trip report it's not really asking anything
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:13:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Another one for Perl: http://news.perlfoundation.org/2013/02/perl-5-grant-application-trave-1.html
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:13:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I'm generally not against the idea of a travel grant. From my recollection of conversations around fund raising, people were leery of doing it too much (rtyler, do you remember differently?). We don't really have a whole *lot* of funds, so using our funds for travel grants is less money we have to support infrastructure, etc. So given all this, I do think that something with a more tangible benefit should be expected.
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:15:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> So for example, if sponsoring someone to come to a conference so that they could be in physical proximity to speed of collaboration of a feature in core or a plugin, I would consider that a tangible benefit.
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:15:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> to speed up collaboration...
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:16:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> in that sense orrc is primarily interested in mobile development related things, and http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/126595572/ we are planning is for large scale deployments, so it's not exactly a good fit
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:17:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Not for that reason.
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> All right, I think I'll circle back to orrc and see if we can come up with "why the project should spend money" write-up like http://news.perlfoundation.org/2013/02/perl-5-grant-application-trave-1.html
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:18:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> As you say, I think the idea seems OK, so we just need to look at a specific case to vote.
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:18:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I like the format of that Perl one. Clearly talks about benefits to the community, and what are the committed to deliverables.
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:18:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;smccarthy&gt;</span> I am trying to use groovy to copy a jenkins job, and change the default Choice parameter value. I see that value is a final String, so it can't be changed. Is there an example how to do this? This is what I have so far : http://pastebin.com/sTYzmzHz
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:19:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I'll float the trial balloon to see if anyone else is willing to do something similar for other upcoming events
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:19:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think that's good enough for this for now

<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:21:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> OK, if we say we want to promote the LTS more
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:22:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> why don't we place the LTS more pominent instead of the normal release
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:22:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> so I would switch the tabs
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:22:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> hmm, personally I'd still like to promote main line releases
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:23:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> There are two aspects to this. What we want to promote, and what people are more interested in having access to.
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:23:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Do we have data on split of LTS vs main releases?
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:23:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> installations
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:23:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> I think we could split the data
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:23:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> ust havend done
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:24:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> seems like a nice addition to http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:24:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> its just that still a lot of people I was tlaking to - did not realise there is a LTS
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:24:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> yes, I can update the stats...
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:25:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> to me, a part of it seems like doing something to catch more problems in main line releases before it ships
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:25:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> thats a good point
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:26:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> like testing common plugins with RCs
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:26:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> The last remoting classloader improvements regressions would have been caught if I were doing that
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:27:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;codepython7771&gt;</span> http://bpaste.net/show/uNQ6O4uSKGjeBtUbV1Sz/ - can anyone help me fix this problem. Anyone knows where to fix this username/password thats creating the problem
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:27:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> and that also brings me to the agenda I was going to post for the next meeting --- improve out of the box experience by bundling more common plugins
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:28:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Before moving on to that though...
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:28:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> So gong back to imods original comment about making LTS more prominent.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:28:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I'm looking at http://jenkins-ci.org right now.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:29:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I think one thing we could do is move the version number into the tab, so that you don't have to click to see the version number of main compared to LTS.
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:29:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> For me, that's always the first bit of information I'm interested in.
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:29:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> true, me too
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:29:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, I can do that
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:30:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Then in terms of which one gets top billing, I think we have to look at the data and try to see which one people are more interested in.
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:30:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I would imagine that a pie chart of # of installations by version would look worse than the Android fragmentation chart.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:30:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> :-)
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:31:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> ok, I'll try to get the stats updated with this separation
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:31:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> not tomorrow yet, but soon I hope
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:32:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> shall we leave it at that?
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:32:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;imod&gt;</span> I'm fine
