<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">18:02:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I hope vjuranek and ogondza are here
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">18:03:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So we settled the train model, but we haven't decided when to start
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">18:03:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> train model meaning?
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">18:03:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line</span>
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">18:03:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> besides that vjuranek gets to wear a conductor's hat
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:04:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> To make the release more predictable, we are comitting to release LTS on the scheduled cycles
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:04:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So say we pick the next LTS baseline today
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:04:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> in 2 weeks we push RC, a release in 4 weeks, etc
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:05:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> that seems reasonable
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:05:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> To start this process we need to pick the base line, which I hope to do today
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:05:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> is that enough time to qualify the release?
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:06:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> the community ratings for 1.554 are pretty good
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:06:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> ogondza seems this is feasible
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:06:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> thinks
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:06:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes, http://jenkins-ci.org/changelog
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:06:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> in fact, 554 might be the best release we've had by the numbers in a long time
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:07:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Isn't that bit too new?
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:07:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> 1.548?
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:07:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> it will have been almost 2 months old by the time LTS is released
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:07:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jglick:</span> WDYT?
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:07:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> there are just *so many* bug fixes in the releases from 548 to 554
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:09:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> 1.543
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:09:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> that's so old!
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:09:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Why would we not pick the newest release meeting time criteria?
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:09:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Unless it is though to be particularly buggy.
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:09:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> The intent of favoring older releases was that there has been more time for problems to be discovered. If people feel that a newer release is getting wide adoption, we could go newer.
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> We could hardly backport anything if we are going with 1.554
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:10:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> That's not necessarily a bad thing. :)
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:10:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:10:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">jglick:</span> but I assume you are arguing for 1.554?
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:11:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Yes, or something near it.
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:11:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> 37 +1s and only two bad ratings.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:12:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, then let's do that
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:12:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> \o/
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:12:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> (One of which also applies to the current LTS line, due to a security fix, so not a problem specifically in this build.)
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:12:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#agreed </span><span class="cmdline">next LTS baseline is 1.554</span>
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:13:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Mind you, I have not examined the issues reported for immediately preceding builds.
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:13:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> But I do not see why in general we would need pick something as new as possible.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:13:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> We don't track when ratings are added, right? So we can't tell how soon after a release people start reporting bad ratings?
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:13:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Maybe we do if we look at the database
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:14:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> nah, we don't
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:14:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> it'd be good to add

<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:14:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> The rate at which people find problems (and rate a release) could help give us some more information to gauge the stability of a release to choose for LTS.
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:14:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> (but not seeing anything scary there)
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:15:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> and release April 18th
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:15:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;larrys&gt;</span> Would be nice to have people rate the version of Jenkins they are running from within the admin screens of Jenkins... might solicit more feedback that way too...
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:15:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> jglick, trying to parse "But I do not see why in general we would need pick something as new as possible." Are you advocating favoring newer releases?
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:16:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Well, subject to our usual “soak time” constraint.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:16:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">larrys:</span> Maybe we should randomly show something in /manage to ask to rate the current version
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:17:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">BTW the backend is https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-rating if anyone wants to hack</span>
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:17:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> oh
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:17:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> there is a pull request from kinow
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:17:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I would hope to avoid choosing a relatively new release to base LTS on, then finding out halfway through that there are serious problems with it, then having to either go back and choose an older one for better stability, or put a lot more effort into backporting bug fixes.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:17:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OMG, 40K LoC addition
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:17:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I mean, I hope to avoid that situation.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:18:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> come back to that perhaps, we have a meeting :)
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:18:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:18:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> the benefit of that approach is that we'll find serious problems faster
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:19:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> How would that find serious problems faster?
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:19:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> then letting users organically run into them
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">18:20:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> That's sort of how we're doing it right now. Organically discovering them. That's essentially what the ratings are.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">18:20:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> We've used to pick up LTS base versions that are a lot older than 2 releases back
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">18:20:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> IIRC, 1.532 was a bit of exception that we picked a very new release at the time of choosing
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">18:20:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Mostly because that gave more time for the organic discovery process to find problems.
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">18:21:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> How many patches to the LTS are done because of the extra testing that vjuraneck has done?
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">18:22:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> We don't run these tests to find problems
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">18:23:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> We'd just run them to verify nothing is too broken after backporting
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">18:23:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> "too broken" heh
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">18:24:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Maybe we could start the clock ticking 2 weeks from now
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">18:24:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> OK, so I don't feel like I have a satisfactory answer to rtyler's assertion that picking a newer release to base LTS on will help us find serious problems faster.
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">18:24:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Give 1.554 a bit more time to be battle tested
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">18:24:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> and give us a time to build up acceptance-test-harness too
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">18:24:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nanonyme&gt;</span> Hmm, what's that?
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">18:25:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">18:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Also, the community rating should be taken with a grain of salt, too
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">18:27:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I agree, but that's what we start with.
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">18:27:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Say 1.543 only has one minor bug fix yet its rating drastically improves
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">18:27:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Yeah, that's why I was curious about when these ratings come in.
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">18:28:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Maybe we should also be considering installed base of each release. How widely a release is being used in addition to the community ratings.
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">18:28:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> As a method for picking LTS candidates.
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">18:28:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> nominees.
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">18:28:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> 1.543 had a critical bug fix, FWIW, but I must be missing the point here.
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">18:29:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> 1543 only has a fix for JENKINS-20800
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">18:29:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jenkins-admin&gt;</span> JENKINS-20800:HTML metacharacters not escaped in log messages (Resolved) http://jenkins-ci.org/issue/20800
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">18:29:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I don't think it has impact on most users
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">18:29:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> The point, from my perspective, is to favor stability over newness for the LTS. But how we judge stability is based on sparse data sets.
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">18:29:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> That was a crucial security fix.
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">18:30:50 </span><span class="nka">* kohsuke</span> <span class="ac">browses through changelog up and down</span>
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">18:31:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I guess this time we do want to pick &gt;=1.551 because of security fixes
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">18:31:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> That avoids a lot of backporting
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">18:31:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> And that's a totally reasonable choice to make.
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">18:32:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> I guess I am not seeing what the purpose would be of intentionally picking something old with lots of bugs we know were since fixed. Any release has tons of bugs in it, most of them quite longstanding. We should just be on the lookout for releases that had some kind of major refactoring that seems to have been incomplete and introduced a lot of embarrassing regressions.
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">18:33:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> The theory is that we know more about older releases than we know about newer ones. In the past, we have been willing to backport the most critical fixes to the LTS.
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">18:34:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> I suppose it depends on where you set the threshold for “critical fix”. For recent LTSs it has been fairly low.
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">18:34:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> As a middle ground, I suggest we officially bless 1.554 in the next meeting
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">18:35:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> It gives time for various things as I said, and it lets vjuranek and ogondza say no
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">18:35:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> seems reasonable
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">18:35:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> +1 to that
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">18:35:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> So then when is 1.554.1 scheduled?
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">18:35:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;larrys&gt;</span> While I appreciate the hand written changelog, I think having links to the commits between releases would be nice as well, similar to how plugins have "chances since last version" links to Github... I'm sure there are some changes that slip through from time to time...
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">18:36:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> we decide this one way or other in 2 week
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">18:36:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> Yes there are a lot of changes that do not get recorded. This is a conversation that keeps happening but there has been no real movement on it.
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">18:36:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> backport open from April 2-16th
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">18:36:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nanonyme&gt;</span> Btw, is there a real "bugfixes only" policy for LTS .2+?
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">18:36:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> then RC on 16th, release on April 30th

<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">18:37:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jglick&gt;</span> So is that the start of the proposed 12-week cycle?
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">18:37:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes, April 2nd starts the 12 week cycles
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">18:37:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nanonyme&gt;</span> kohsuke, good, then I haven't been lying to our IT :) I told them they should attempt to use as high dot release of their LTS as possible
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">18:37:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nanonyme&gt;</span> They seem to think LTS's mature over time *eyeroll*

<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">18:39:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> thanks
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">18:40:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> so, the biggest part of this that I wanted to talk about was:
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">18:40:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">"Migrate to Puppetmaster-based configuration management infrastructure"</span>
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">18:40:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> kohsuke has already been made aware of some of my work here
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">18:41:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> basically, I've reached out to Puppet Labs, and they will be offering some help to get us migrated to Puppet Enterprise
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">18:41:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> and a continuous delivery pipeline for our infrastructure code
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">18:42:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Is puppetizing our existing services not a part of the goal?
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">18:42:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I thought that is a major goal
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">18:42:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> that's a major goal for *us*, I'm not sure yet whether they'll help with that in a substantial way
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">18:42:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jenkins-builds&gt;</span> Project jenkins_main_trunk build #3241: SUCCESS in 1 hr 31 min: http://ci.jenkins-ci.org/job/jenkins_main_trunk/3241/
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">18:42:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jenkins-builds&gt;</span> Jesse Glick: updateByXml need not call reload; just causes duplicated work.
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">18:42:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">18:42:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I've not hashed out the work with them just yet
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">18:43:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> the primary goals that I have to accomplish with their help are:
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">18:43:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> * Refactor our Puppet infrastructure from masterless to master-ful(?)
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">18:43:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> * Create a blueprint for developing, testing and deploying new "stuff"
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">18:44:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> if in the process of the second item, we move more stuff into Puppet, great
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">18:44:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> btu I don't know the extent of what we would do
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">18:44:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I have a call next tuesday to figure that out more
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">18:44:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">18:44:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> basically, they're experts at running a good Puppet infrastructure, that's what I want the most help with
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">18:45:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nanonyme&gt;</span> Btw, is the intention to have some or most of the configurations publicly visible as per "this is how things should be done in 2014+"?
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">18:45:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> they're not experts at deploying things like Mirrorbrain
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">18:45:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> if we are spending one time concentrated effort to do upgrades and stuff that has been long overdue, that's fine, but if we can automate those in such a way that future upgrades are easier, that's even better
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">18:45:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nanonyme:</span> yes, except for sensitive information like passwords and private keys, all should be open sourced
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">18:46:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> I called out Upgrading core services as a separate goal in the roadmap for that reason
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">18:46:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> so when I see something like "upgrade JIRA", I'm trying to understand whether it means "puppetize JIRA and prove that to ourselves by upgrading" or "let's do this update in the same way we've been doing"
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">18:46:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nanonyme&gt;</span> Would also be nice to have some recommendations included on how you can integrate the sensitive information with the rest of stuff. This sounds like something we might want to mimick some day.
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">18:47:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">nanonyme:</span> on that note, not sure whether it belongs here, but I'd like to see hiera-gpg (or whatever else that lets us handle secrets) deployed here
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">18:47:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> depending on how we feel about the "modern puppet" work, we can evaluate then which is better :)
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">18:47:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> I imagine that Puppet Labs will help with the 1-4 line items in the work scoped for the "modern puppet" project
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">18:48:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> but 5 I'm unsure of
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">18:48:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I'll definitely keep the community aware of what's going on on the infra@ list, but I wanted to call attention to the roadmap as I've laid it out thus far
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">18:49:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> "CD pipeline" as in changes like JIRA upgrade would go through this CD pipeline?
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">18:49:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> hopefully!
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">18:49:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nanonyme&gt;</span> 5 would also be a good chance to evaluate the quality of documentation and tooling  gotten from Puppet Labs during 1-4
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">18:50:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#idea </span><span class="cmdline">I really want to see "figure out how to handle secrets and prove that it works by putting SSL certs in infra-puppet repo" tracked somewhere</span>
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">18:51:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I'll definitely bring that up with the puppetlabs folks when we start hacking
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">18:51:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">I think rtyler is planning some on-site infra hack week in San Francisco, and any other volunteers would be welcome</span>
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">18:51:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I am!
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">18:51:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> anything else on this topic?
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">18:52:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I don't believe so
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">18:52:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;nanonyme&gt;</span> Ie if during 5 non-puppet-labs engineers notice it's excessively hard to migrate a system to Puppet, 1-4 probably needs returning to
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">18:52:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> oh, and I suggest we consider Confluence upgrade carefully --- maybe even punt on it
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">18:52:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> punt it out of 2014?
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">18:53:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> All the peripheral systems that talk to Confluence needs to be modified since Atlassian had completely redone their Wiki format in 4.0
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">18:53:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Every automation that pushes pages into Confluence gets affected
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">18:53:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> we can discuss this more later, but I believe upgrading Confluence and JIRA this year are critical tasks
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">18:53:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">kohsuke to inventory our backend systems that talk to Confluence</span>
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">18:54:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> You are right, but it's daunting just to think about it
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">18:54:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> JIRA is OK
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">18:54:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> it won't be easy
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">18:54:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> perhaps we can find some Atlassian folks who will want to help :)
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">18:54:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;larrys&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> like the bamboo devs? ;)
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">18:55:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I think that covers this topic as far as today is concerned, I didn't have specific action items to cover, just wanted to bring the roadmap up in a meeting
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">18:55:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Thus another chpater added to the legend of rtyler, the dude who gets stuff for free
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">18:55:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">next meeting</span>
