18:01:21 <kohsuke> #topic JUC status update / travel grant?
18:01:47 <kohsuke> hmm, doesn't look like lisa is here
18:02:08 <kohsuke> so maybe we should start with 1.554.1 RC status
18:02:18 <kohsuke> #topic 1.554.1 RC status
18:02:26 <kohsuke> jglick: ogondza: ping
18:02:33 <jglick> present
18:02:44 <ogondza> I have just sent status report to dev list
18:02:50 <kohsuke> ah indeed
18:03:03 <kohsuke> I wonder if marcomiller ported stuff he wanted in this LTS
18:03:14 <ogondza> He did.
18:03:18 <kohsuke> yay
18:03:28 <kohsuke> all right, then I'll produce RC today
18:03:43 <marcomiller> did indeed =)
18:04:01 <jglick> JENKINS-19081 was an RFE rather than a bug fix strictly speaking; did we want this backported?
18:04:04 <jenkins-admin> JENKINS-19081:Download update center from master by default (Resolved) http://jenkins-ci.org/issue/19081
18:04:31 <kohsuke> Hmm, there still is a lot of flakiness in the acceptance test
18:04:54 <ogondza> jglick, You are right though I like that a lot
18:05:29 <jglick> Well so do I obviously, but still.
18:06:11 <jglick> Could be interpreted as a fix only in case we *expect* browser-based downloading to be broken in the near future.
18:06:45 <jglick> Is there a list of lts-candidate issues which are too young for this or which were otherwise rejected?
18:07:03 <ogondza> LTSs https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=12146
18:08:01 <ogondza> no candidate was rejected. There was one issue that was labeled by mistake (already backported)
18:08:06 <jglick> OK, nothing that looks critical.
18:08:23 <ogondza> a lot was already in 1.554
18:08:37 <jglick> Seems like we are ready for RC.
18:08:41 <kohsuke> Yeah
18:08:48 <kohsuke> #agreed 1.554.1 RC is good to go
18:09:35 <kohsuke> ogondza:  Maybe this is bit off topic but have you looked into why some of the acceptance tests appear so flaky?
18:09:42 <kohsuke> I will have to find time digging in myself
18:10:15 <kohsuke> One pattern I see is that it occasionally appears to fail to find tool installer data
18:10:16 <ogondza> not yet
18:10:39 <kohsuke> like https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/core/job/acceptance-test-harness/156/testReport/
18:10:45 <ogondza> I am still not happy about its stability
18:10:53 <kohsuke> Looks like this accounts for the majority of the randomness
18:11:23 <kohsuke> I was also going to try to run selenium on Sauce Labs by using our account
18:11:29 <kohsuke> That'll give us screenshots and all.
18:11:32 <kohsuke> Anyway
18:11:44 <jglick> Then maybe JENKINS-19081 should be used in the tests to download more reliably from master. :-) Once the tool metadata is fixed to include signatures, that is.
18:11:46 <jenkins-admin> JENKINS-19081:Download update center from master by default (Resolved) http://jenkins-ci.org/issue/19081
18:12:31 <kohsuke> #topic JUC status update / travel grant?
18:12:40 <kohsuke> LisaWells: yay you are here
18:12:52 <LisaWells> yes, here
18:12:55 <LisaWells> Alyssa too
18:12:57 <Alyssa> i can provide the status update
18:13:09 <kohsuke> It's all yours
18:13:40 <Alyssa> Registration for boston & berlins & israel is currently live
18:13:49 <Alyssa> boston= 70 registrants
18:13:50 <kohsuke> I've seen the submissions to JUC Berlin and they were all quite impressive
18:13:59 <Alyssa> berlin = 24 reg
18:14:08 <Alyssa> indeed
18:14:26 <Alyssa> israel = 4 reg
18:14:27 <kohsuke> I wonder if the dates are on Jenkins event calendar
18:14:40 <LisaWells> actually I was going to ask you today if you could put them there :)
18:14:41 <kohsuke> http://jenkins-ci.org/content/event-calendar
18:14:55 <kohsuke> Yeah they are not
18:15:03 * kohsuke goes off to add them
18:15:38 <kohsuke> I feel like folks in the events list should have write access to this calendar
18:15:44 <kohsuke> like kinow
18:15:45 <Alyssa> we are working on finalizing the agenda. hopefully we'll have agenda for boston/berlin up by early next wk
18:16:17 <Alyssa> agreed KK
18:17:01 <Alyssa> here are links to reg sites http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-boston-ma-june-18-2014-tickets-10558652213
18:17:22 <Alyssa> for berlink   http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-berlin-germany-june-25-2014-tickets-10557974185
18:17:35 <rtyler> kohsuke: fyi, i'm around but I can't actively pay attention here
18:17:42 <rtyler> so please ping me if there's anything for me to chime in on
18:17:51 <Alyssa> israel http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-herzliya-israel-july-16-2014-tickets-10558710387
18:18:01 <kohsuke> rtyler:  no worries
18:18:49 <Alyssa> Early bird pricing will end soon  boston: 4/19  berlin 4/27
18:18:51 <kohsuke> our usual German folks aren't really here: fredg, orrc, drulli
18:19:17 <kohsuke> Alyssa: you told me that finding a venue in Berlin turns out to be quite a challenge
18:19:26 <kohsuke> do you want to mention a bit about that?
18:19:40 <Alyssa> well, we're going with kosmos
18:19:56 <Alyssa> we're in contract w/ location so there's no turning back
18:19:59 <kohsuke> #info http://www.kosmos-berlin.de/en/home.html
18:20:13 <kohsuke> calendar added
18:20:58 <Alyssa> perhaps for future JUC Berlin we can get suggestions for venues but we
18:21:10 <Alyssa> are set for this one in june
18:21:22 <kohsuke> right
18:21:25 <orrc> Kosmos is next door to the computer games museum, so it's a good choice :)
18:21:28 <LisaWells> do we have a venue for Bay Area?
18:21:32 <LisaWells> if not, any suggestions?
18:21:57 <Alyssa> +orrc: thnx that's good to know :o)
18:22:04 <kohsuke> orrc: so we got some competition for attendance :-)
18:22:34 <Alyssa> LisaWells: we currently do not have a venue for bay area
18:22:48 <KostyaSha> is there any global proxy in jenkins?
18:23:00 <KostyaSha> is it plugins configuration?
18:23:04 <kohsuke> What about Yahoo folks that they said they are willing?
18:23:27 <kohsuke> I've been to their campus a few times and they got the 2nd floor of the cafeteria entirely for events
18:23:51 <Alyssa> haven't checked with them. who's the contact for that ?
18:24:12 <kohsuke> I have to dig that up, they were in the scalability summit
18:24:21 <kohsuke> Along the same line, netflix?
18:24:23 <Alyssa> can they host 400 -500 people ?
18:24:37 <Alyssa> i've received out to neflix but no response from them
18:25:07 <kohsuke> I don't know about 400 people, but Yahoo sites, it might
18:25:11 <hare_brain> I remember asking around with people still at Yahoo about the cafeteria, and they said they donâ€™t rent that out.
18:25:54 <kohsuke> Now that Google Cloud Platform does Jenkins, maybe they can help?
18:26:44 <Alyssa> kohsuke: contact plz ?
18:26:57 <kohsuke> The event would have to be more community and less vendors, but then if the venue is free we don't need so many sponsors, so it just might work out...
18:27:15 <Alyssa> agreed
18:27:19 <kohsuke> It could be like how Copenhagen event is run
18:28:03 <kohsuke> hare_brain: how does various user groups  get Yahoo venues for their events?
18:28:16 <kohsuke> It works because it's just a few hours in the evening?
18:28:27 <hare_brain> Yes.
18:28:34 <kohsuke> OK, that makes sense
18:29:08 <Alyssa> that's it for me for JUC status update. unless there are questions for me, i'll let lisa take it from here
18:29:37 <kohsuke> orrc: how do we get the words out in the developers in Berlin or broader Germany?
18:29:43 <LisaWells> so does anyone have good ideas to get the word out?
18:29:51 <LisaWells> KK just said what I was typing...
18:30:20 <kohsuke> Maybe some sites we can post ad?
18:30:29 <LisaWells> Same for Boston - need communities (JUGs, Agile groups, etc) who might help us spread the word
18:30:32 <kohsuke> Perhaps like german version of Hacker News...
18:31:07 <LisaWells> also - would anyone like to volunteer to help promote the JUCs?
18:31:40 <kohsuke> JAX is in May
18:32:00 <LisaWells> I think we are handing out JUC Berlin stickers at JAX?
18:32:01 <Alyssa> We have made JUC stickers to be passed out at JAX
18:32:13 <afex> hi, is it possible to load a private key from the credentials plugin during a shell build step? i'd like to grab the private key contents during some command line operations
18:32:18 <kohsuke> There'll be a lot of developers there, if only we know how to get there
18:32:20 <LisaWells> if anyone else wants a stock of JUC Berlin stickers, we could send them
18:32:44 <LisaWells> Devoxx is this month as well, right?
18:32:57 <baniir> why are users and credentials handled separately? i'm confused by the difference
18:33:17 <afex> unfortunately ruby's net-ssh doesn't seem to be compatible with the ssh-agent plugin, so i'm attempting to workaround it
18:33:19 <kohsuke> I thought that was in France
18:33:31 <Alyssa> Devoxx is in Paris I think. Cyrille mentioned French wont go to Germany for events
18:33:32 <kohsuke> afex: baniir: let's postpone the questions until after the project meeting
18:33:39 <LisaWells> yes, it is
18:33:43 <kohsuke> :-) that's what I suspected!
18:33:52 <LisaWells> hoping some might come - worth having the stickers there
18:34:01 <afex> kohsuke: didnt' realize this was an official meeting, sorry
18:34:08 <kohsuke> np
18:34:12 <LisaWells> people may also travel to Devoxx from Germany, no?
18:34:33 <kohsuke> jglick: did you get the e-mail between I sent to you and two other folks we met at the last Jenkins event in Boston?
18:34:42 <baniir> kohsuke: sure; also didn't realize a meeting was in progress
18:35:03 <jglick> kohsuke: have it somewhere
18:35:08 <kohsuke> I think having a periodic meetup going is good for multiple reasons
18:35:28 <kohsuke> ... one of which is that we can reach people who would be interested in events like this
18:35:36 <LisaWells> +1
18:36:33 <kohsuke> All right, let's hope that the banner deployment on Wiki and JIRA would spread the words
18:36:44 <orrc> yeah, I don't know what the German equivalent of Hacker News is. fredg or kutzi might have a better idea
18:37:01 <orrc> a lot of people read www.heise.de â€” they have an event calendar that I can try and add the JUC to
18:37:04 <LisaWells> once the agenda is up, how does everyone feel about spreading the link via their social media networks?
18:37:20 <fredg02> hey, sorry for being late
18:37:27 <kohsuke> orrc: I think that'd be very helpful
18:38:03 <Alyssa> orrc: how about log JUGs as lisa mentioned?
18:38:12 <kohsuke> fredg02: we were just wondering how to spread words to the German developers about JUC
18:38:53 <Alyssa> orrc: sorry meant local not log
18:39:11 <fredg02> we should definitely spread the word through the local Java user groups.
18:39:19 <kohsuke> This heise online must be somehow related to http://www.h-online.com/
18:39:25 <danielbeck> any idea how to get on http://www.heise.de/ix/veranstaltungen/ ?
18:39:49 <danielbeck> kohsuke: h online was the English version of heise.de
18:40:20 <kohsuke> I forgot that danielbeck is a German, too
18:40:52 <kohsuke> ah, the wonder of Google Translate
18:41:42 <fredg02> yeah, heise.de shouldn't be a big problem.
18:41:59 <kohsuke> maybe we'd have to ask through http://www.heise.de/ix/kontakt/
18:42:04 <LisaWells> alyssa: could we offer a bobblehead to people who volunteer to help promote JUC in Boston & Germany (to be picked up at the conference)?
18:42:21 <Alyssa> absolutely
18:42:34 <orrc> abayer will be talking at the JUG here in Cologne this month. I'm sure he can do some promotion
18:42:42 <Alyssa> we have jenkins badge pins this year too
18:43:07 <kohsuke> orrc: is he living in Germany nowadays or what?
18:43:08 <LisaWells> those are going to be super-cool - can't wait
18:43:19 <orrc> kohsuke: he's just here on holiday, as far as I know
18:43:36 <Alyssa> orrc: great idea!! that'll be helpful
18:44:34 <kohsuke> Any more on this topic?
18:44:54 <LisaWells> Do we want to talk about travel grants?
18:45:00 <kohsuke> Ah yes
18:45:21 <kohsuke> So we've launched the patron program and that raised $3000
18:46:07 <kohsuke> So I thought it might let us think about a future travel grant to one of the events
18:46:42 <LisaWells> in previous years, people have requested them but there was no funding source.
18:46:54 <kohsuke> Or if anyone can think of a good way to spend money for the benefit of the project, I'm all ears
18:47:25 <kohsuke> ... like finding some part time sysadmin who can help with up-keeping, perhaps
18:48:27 <kohsuke> All right, I don't really have much to add beyond that. Maybe I should send an e-mail to the list and see if anyone reacts
18:48:46 <kohsuke> #topic next meeting
18:49:13 <kohsuke> would be April 30th same time
18:49:27 <kohsuke> all right, that's it, thank you!
