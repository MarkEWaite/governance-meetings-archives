---------------
* LINK:

  (kohsuke, 18:01:27)
* Q4 patron ads on Jenkins Wiki  (kohsuke, 18:01:39)
  * AGREED: the proposed message change looks OK to us  (kohsuke,

* Plugins not getting forked into jenkinsci, or not getting released
  from there  (kohsuke, 18:05:51)
  * IDEA: Plugins that are not hosted in jenkinsci GitHub org do not get
    wiki pages on jenkinsci.org, nor do they show up as an available
    plugin from default update center  (hare_brain, 18:12:35)
  * IDEA: Add UI to plugin manager for “report a bug”. Plugin authors
    can add a link to their issue tracker to the plugin metadata.
    (hare_brain, 18:15:50)

    plugins that do not follow the encouraged hosting guideline

    18:34:03)
