<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">19:02:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> CloudBees marketing people are interested in putting ad on jenkins-ci.org
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">19:03:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Are they going to pay for the space? Do we get a TAC?
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">19:03:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> They are willing to spend like a few 1000$s
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">19:03:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And I felt we needed to get the sense of how people react before starting to calculate what kind of impressions/calendar periods/etc that it translates to
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">19:03:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> What is TAC?
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">19:04:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> traffic acquisition cost.
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">19:04:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Is that different from "pay for the space"?
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">19:04:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Not for the purposes of this discussion.
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">19:05:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">19:05:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> On the budget side, it's not that we are in need of urgent money
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">19:05:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I guess my first question would be what kind of ads.
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">19:06:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> ads related to CloudBees Jenkins products
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:06:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think it's quite negotiable,
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">19:06:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Oh, I meant what form of ads. Banners, sponsored links, etc.
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">19:06:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> yup, negotiable!
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:06:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zxvff&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> I think it's a great idea, depending on what sort of ad it is
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:06:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I just assumed it is a banner
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:07:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> we were thinking just a banner space but very open to suggestions
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:07:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sleepynate&gt;</span> just a user here, but "need someone to host your jenkins?" banner under the downloads would be amenable to me
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:07:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zxvff&gt;</span> might be good to negotiate a revenue share depending on the service advertised
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:07:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> or maybe something like google adwords?
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:07:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zxvff&gt;</span> also find out what sort of company it is to try to get a better sense of what their budget is
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:07:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zxvff&gt;</span> google ad words will not be very profitable
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:07:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Sounds like no one is running away screaming from the idea....
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:07:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zxvff&gt;</span> &lt;-- internet marketer
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:07:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> yeah, that's good to know
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:07:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ojacobson&gt;</span> I'm not, but only because I already run adblock.
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:08:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;ojacobson&gt;</span> My experience is that ad revenue is a trap; once you have it, it's hard to get rid of, and it repels a not-inconsiderable number of customers, diminishing "real" revenue. jenkins-ci.org doesn't *have* "real revenue", though, so that model may not be relevant
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:08:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> we were hoping to offer ads for relevant things Jenkins users might want: training courses, hosted Jenkins, Jenkins Enterprise plugins, etc
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:08:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> rtyler or abayer around to weigh in
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:08:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Just for the record, I'm totally fine if we say NO.
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:09:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> what's going on?
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:09:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> My gut reaction is wariness, to be honest.
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:09:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Ad space on jenkins-ci.org
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I'm not strongly opposed, but I'm not a huge fan either.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">19:09:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I can't imagine why
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">19:09:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> what problem are we solving?
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:09:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Not a problem. An opportunity.
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">19:09:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;sleepynate&gt;</span> well, it's not just any ads either, it's specifically cloudbees wants to advertise their jenkins stuff, right?
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">19:10:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I would say, that once you open the door to this stuff...
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">19:10:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">sleepynate:</span> yes, but I assume this would need to be non-discriminatory
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">19:10:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> If we do it, and I'm not saying that we should, we should plan for additional requests, not just one off it for CloudBees.
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">19:10:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Strongly agreed.
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">19:11:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I thought codehaus used to put ads on their wiki but it doesn't look like they do
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">19:12:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I'm against it but mostly for touchy feely reasons
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">19:12:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I don't want the OSS project to be cloudbees leadgen
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">19:12:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> So I think the questions to answer, in order of priority are: do we want to allow ads on jenkins-ci.org? what kind of ads? what pages to we want to allow ads on?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">19:12:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> rtyler those are valid.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">19:13:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> what I think is totally acceptable, is to have cvontent on jenkins-ci.org about stuff that cloudbees is doing *WITH* jenkins
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">19:13:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> the same way we talk about praqma or whoever that is
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">19:13:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I am undecided myself. And it if we do put ads on, I feel it needs to be done in a way so that it's not disruptive to people trying to find stuff.
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">19:13:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> No rollovers, pop-overs, whatever.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">19:14:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> heh
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">19:14:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> "continue on to jenkins-ci.org [x]"
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">19:14:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Exactly.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">19:14:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> turns out codehaus does put ad on wiki. I forgot I had adblock
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">19:14:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> hah
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">19:14:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> you can see it at the bottom of pages like http://groovy.codehaus.org/
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">19:14:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> LOL
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">19:15:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> That's not too bad.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">19:15:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> on pages like http://groovy.codehaus.org/Roadmap you see it in two places
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">19:15:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> both at the top and the bottom
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">19:15:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> looks like that is the standard design in Codehaus Confluence
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">19:15:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Not sure what they did to kill off the top banner in http://groovy.codehaus.org/
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">19:16:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Probably just don't have an ad well defined for that page.
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:16:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Or nothing scheduled against it.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:17:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I note that ad being low key is very important to many people
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">19:17:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> That's good to know
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:18:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Does it create a wrong impression about the independence of the project? How big a concern is that?
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:18:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> rtyler is -1, sounds like abayer is -0.5, hare_brain is 0, zxvff was +1
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:18:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> so far
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:18:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I missed what product we're talking about
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">19:18:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> or is it just a general thing
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:19:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Yeah, I'm -0.5 at best. I'd probably be closer to -0 if it wasn't just CloudBees, to be honest.
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:19:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Impetus was CloudBees wanting to advertise.
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:19:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> I suspect it'd be used for all sorts of things. training, two products, "Jenkins as a service", ...
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">19:20:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> here's what I would propose
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">19:20:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I think the fact that many Jenkins contributors work for CloudBees, that impression of independence will always be harder than average.
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">19:20:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I think that's *okay*, but we define a monthly sponsorship package
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">19:20:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> This doesn't make it any worse, I don't think.
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">19:20:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> and define the criteria to make sure we're not displaying any ads that conflict with the mission of the open source project
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">19:20:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> jenkins training ads would be good IMHO
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">19:20:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> artifactory ads, notsomuch
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">19:21:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> if anything, to me that is an argument for not doing anything (like this) that makes it more complicated to explain than today
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">19:21:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> Yeah, that's my thought.
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">19:22:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Let's say I'm -1 if CloudBees is the only advertiser (despite my love for you guys!) due to the perception issue, +1 if there are multiple advertisers from the get go.
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">19:22:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> And assuming the ads aren't obtrusive blah blah.
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">19:22:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> How do we canvas to see if there's other interest to advertise on the site?
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">19:23:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> making it non-discriminatory while being selective is tricky, isn't it
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">19:23:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> heh, oh yes
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">19:23:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> It sounds like rtyler is -1 for advertising commerical products.
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">19:23:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> for commercial products that would detract from jenkins OSS
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">19:23:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> artifactory was a bad example actually
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">19:23:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> more like atlassian
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">19:24:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> BETTER CI WITH BAMBOOZLE
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">19:24:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> TRY ATLOOSIAN
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">19:24:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> is non-discriminatory really an issue? seems like "all ads / content subject to community approval" would cover things. you don't have to take all advertisers
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">19:24:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I am trying to understand the distinction you're making, rtyler. JFrog makes a commercial product too.
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">19:25:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> they don't make anything that could be competing with the Jenkins OSS provides though correct?
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">19:25:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Ah. I get where you're coming from now.
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">19:25:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LisaWells:</span> yeah, but we need some guidelines ourselves to decide what to approve and what not to
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">19:26:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> artifactory and cloudbees provide tools that live in an ecosystem *with* jenkins
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">19:26:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> jenkins is better with jfrog
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">19:26:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> so I'm okay with that :)
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">19:26:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LisaWells:</span>  And transparency would help to prevent someone from saying "look Kohsuke is preferentially treating CloudBees!"
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">19:26:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> What if NetFlix came along and wanted to advertise? (Hyptotheically.)
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">19:27:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> so guidelines might be content that promotes / supports Jenkins, nothing that detracts from / competes with the product, only relevant ads for things that will help developers as they use Jenkins
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">19:27:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LisaWells:</span> yes, that's along my line of thinking as well
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">19:27:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> I personally would like to see it not as an ad-deal based thing if we were to do it, but rather continued monthly or annual support
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">19:27:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> So now we're talking about curating ads.
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">19:27:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> if it's irrelevant, ugly, or distracting, it's out
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">19:28:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> we were thinking monthly - give it a try for a few months and see how it does. if it works, keep it up!
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">19:28:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> So instead of ads generically, maybe "Site sponsors"?
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">19:29:03 </span><span class="nka">* rtyler</span> <span class="ac">nods</span>
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">19:29:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> we do have bills to pay, and having sponsor opportunities is helpful
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">19:29:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Where sponsor is not necessarily a company, but possibly services or other offerings.
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">19:29:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Right. That's what I've been thinking about.
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">19:30:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So now abayer's concern is more relevant, that he'd feel better if there are other sponsors from get go
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">19:30:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> (And having sponsors to help with the bills would make the need for fundraiser drives less necessary.)
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">19:30:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> i think if you posted to the Jenkins CI Linkedin group, or just sent an email to the Users list, you'd get a few volunteers
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">19:31:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> this year we had people lining up to sponsor JUC
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">19:31:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> LisaWells does talking about site sponsorship change what CloudBees had in mind?

<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">19:32:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Thanks for your input rtyler. It was really helpful.
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">19:33:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Sounds like we should create a more concrete draft proposal
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">19:33:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Yeah.
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">19:33:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> before today, I felt we need to first check this kind of proposal is not dead on arrival
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">19:34:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Sounds like resistance to generic ad space, but having focused, curated sponorships could fly, if we had sponsors other than just CloudBees.
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">19:34:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> would have to check but most likely we'd love to sponsor. how would you envision that being different?
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">19:34:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Semantics, mostly. :)
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">19:34:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> then it shouldn't be a problem
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">19:35:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> we love to support Jenkins so that might even be better!
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">19:35:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> All right, shall we move to the next topic?
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">19:35:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">JUC 2014 brainstorming</span>
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">19:35:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Don't get me wrong. I think even with sponsorship, there is a lot of infrastructure to be set up on the site, and for the board to manage the accounting, but possibly less work than dealing with AdSense/AdWords, etc.
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">19:36:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> btw if you just want 1-2 other sponsors and don't need to do an open 'call for sponsors', i can probably find them for you
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">19:36:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> on to JUC 2014 discussion ?
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">19:37:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Sorry, looks like I changed the topic bit too early
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">19:37:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> But I think now it's OK
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">19:37:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Before we move on to that, are there any action items to take for that first oe?
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">19:37:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> one
<a name="l-148"></a><span class="tm">19:37:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">LisaWells / kohsuke to come up with a more concrete plan for further consideration</span>
<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">19:38:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think that's the main one
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">19:38:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">JUC 2014 brainstorming</span>
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">19:39:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Alyssa_ got a lot of feedback on JUC Palo Alto, and she's already thinking about the one for the next year
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">19:39:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> there was suggestion for unconference
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">19:40:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> there's another feedback that said a panel discussion was very interesting and some wanted to see that
<a name="l-154"></a><span class="tm">19:40:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> is this what we still want to add onto JUC 2014?
<a name="l-155"></a><span class="tm">19:40:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> ok. add panel discussion
<a name="l-156"></a><span class="tm">19:40:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And another one that Alyssa_ told me, I think, was that some people felt there were too many sponsor talks and not enough genuine community talks
<a name="l-157"></a><span class="tm">19:41:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> should we limit the # of sponsor talks?
<a name="l-158"></a><span class="tm">19:41:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Also, this year, we did the right thing by having an option to opt-out from sponsors upon signing
<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">19:42:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> ... but I was told that so many people opted out and it would make LisaWells's work more tricky to line up sponsors
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">19:42:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think one question therefore is whether a two-day event is workable
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">19:43:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> It sounds like for us to add any more stuff to it (be it unconference, panel, or more talks), we'd need more hours
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">19:43:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> issue w/ more hours is budget
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">19:43:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Looking at the schedule, I'm visually counting 5 talks by sponsors out of 14, not including the keynote.
<a name="l-164"></a><span class="tm">19:44:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto.cb</span>
<a name="l-165"></a><span class="tm">19:44:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> So that doesn't seem unreasonable.
<a name="l-166"></a><span class="tm">19:45:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> actually 6 sponsor talks
<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">19:45:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> If some didn't even feel like a sponsor talk that's a good sign!
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">19:46:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> If the content is interesting to people, whether it's sponsored or not shouldn't matter.
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">19:47:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Is it possible to get a venue free by shaking down the likes of Y!, Netflix, etc?
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">19:47:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> if that helps cutting the cost drastically, that'd reduce various pressures, no?
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">19:48:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I remember Yahoo! had a huge conference rooms that we've used in some earlier meetups
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">19:48:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> yes it would. but that would limit # of attendees yes?
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">19:48:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Probably
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">19:48:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Those conference rooms wouldn't fit the number of people that showed up at JUC PA
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">19:49:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> I am anticipating 600 people for 2014
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">19:49:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> And might be hard to get them all day.
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">19:50:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Universities really worked well elsewhere in the world
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">19:50:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> How did those events avoid conflicting with classes?
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">19:51:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> It was often free or next to free, and some class rooms can house a large number of people
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">19:51:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> hold event during weekend/summer
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">19:51:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Ones I did in Tokyo, we did it on weekends
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">19:51:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> we'd run into limited days in the year
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">19:52:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> But I suppose most other events that I know weren't a fully day event
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">19:54:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> OK, so venue is a problem.
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">19:54:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Challenge.
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">19:55:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Going back to sponsor talks vs community talks.
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">19:55:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I'm not sure I even know how to define "community talk"
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">19:55:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> It's sounding like the current structure would likely remain, unless we have some breakthrough because of the constraints
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">19:56:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Having a panel session, or some forum for more general Q&amp;A perhaps?
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">19:56:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> data point: we had several more potential sponsors who wanted to do talks, but we ran out of slots
<a name="l-191"></a><span class="tm">19:56:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> and we had several who sponsored anyway but didn't get to talk (they got bag sponsorships, or Scalability Summit sponsorship instead)
<a name="l-192"></a><span class="tm">19:56:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> yes
<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">19:56:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> To me, the key is whether the content of the talk would be of general interest to Jenkins users, not who is giving the talk.
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">19:56:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> i will add panel discussion for 2014
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">19:57:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> My understanding is that for sponsor talks, we just have to give them a slot without us being able to control the content of the talk
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">19:57:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> did we get any feedback that the sponsor talks were not relevant?
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">19:57:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> we do control the content - we kicked several proposals back
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">19:57:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LisaWells:</span> I did see some tweets to that extent
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">19:58:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> My requirement for all speakers, including sponsor is no product pitches.
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">19:58:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;LisaWells&gt;</span> good to know - if you can share specifics, that's helpful
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">19:58:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> speakers do send in their slides prior to the event.
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">19:58:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">LisaWells:</span> yeah, I should have kept it somewhere

<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">20:01:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Would a smaller 2nd day for unconference in Netflix/Yahoo! be interesting?
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">20:01:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Would depend on the topic. Sounds like that scalability summit was a success.
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">20:01:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> It would help us test the setup in a presumably smaller number of people without adding cost
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">20:02:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes, I enjoyed it a lot, and I think there was a lot of interest, indeed
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">20:02:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So I thought of scaling up that setup
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">20:02:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> i'm thinking we mimic what we did this yr but maybe add another smaller room if there's interest
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">20:02:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> My understanding is that we need multiple small rooms for it to work well
<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">20:03:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> I can check w/ Betflix re: additional rooms
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">20:03:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;Alyssa_&gt;</span> Netflix
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">20:03:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Seems like we're going into logistics. Can we wrap up the meeting?
