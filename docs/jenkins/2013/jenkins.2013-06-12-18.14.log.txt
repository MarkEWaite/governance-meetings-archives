18:15:07 <kohsuke> #topic "Jenkins certification" from Tokyo
18:15:11 <kohsuke> #info https://docs.google.com/file/d/18sXYsZJrvkSECZKYfxLFkyDKlnlQTCvpaigY9BW_PTX4pJeEWu2iJyBBQ90S/edit
18:15:29 <kohsuke> I was asked from my Jenkins friends in Tokyo to present this on their behalf becaue they are sound asleep
18:16:01 <kohsuke> SHIFT is one of the companies that's promoting Jenkins in Japan,
18:16:18 <kohsuke> and as a way of propping up adoption/interest or promoting Jenkins users, they came up with this certification idea
18:17:09 <rtyler> it's a bit hard to say "yeah, totally" to something which doesn't seem to have been completed
18:17:26 <rtyler> this deck looks good to me though
18:17:39 <kohsuke> The idea is that this makes it something you can put on your resume, or make this skill something worthwhiel
18:17:41 <rtyler> the split on basic vs. expert is a good one too
18:17:59 <kohsuke> Other people in Japanese Jenkins community are OK with this
18:18:27 <kohsuke> And even though this is only written in English they aren't interested in doing it outside Japan so far
18:18:55 <rtyler> kohsuke: do you know what the licensing arrangement might be for the exam or materials?
18:19:12 <rtyler> i.e. if our friends at Pragwhatever in denmark wanted to help facilitate Jenkins cert. there
18:19:14 <[diecast]> kohsuke: what is Tokyo Tyrant
18:20:03 <rtyler> we currently have CloudBees, Praqma, SHIFT, and a few others who I forget concerned with Jenkins
18:20:32 <kohsuke> rtyler: so they do intend this to be the community thing
18:20:33 <rtyler> I think if SHIFT is willing to develop something, and we say "yes, you can call it a Jenkins Certification" then some allowances for other companies in other markets to license it should be made
18:21:10 <kohsuke> and I talked to them that that's actually works better for them, too, and they agree.
18:21:19 <rtyler> sounds good to me then
18:21:29 <kohsuke> What they told me is that they don't want to lose money, and writing exam and materials do cost
18:21:35 * rtyler nods
18:21:46 <kohsuke> So I thought it'd be perfectly fair that they charge the "exam fee" to cover that cost
18:22:22 <kohsuke> So in principle I don't think they have problems with other countries reusing the materials
18:22:49 <kohsuke> It's more up to us what we think how it should be
18:22:57 <rtyler> I'm not suggesting they need to offer it for free, but "reasonably priced" or something like that would be good
18:23:48 <kohsuke> rtyler: one way to ensure that is that we commission the work to SHIFT
18:23:59 <kohsuke> we as in the project
18:24:52 <kohsuke> but that costs us upfront, I guess
18:25:33 <rtyler> eep
18:26:03 <kohsuke> I'll probably just ask them and CC the mailing list
18:27:13 <kohsuke> more concretely they are seeking the permission to use the name "Jenkins" for this purpose
18:27:21 <kohsuke> rtyler: I take it that you feel OK with it
18:27:31 <kohsuke> Anyone else has any thoughts on this?
18:27:38 <rtyler> I think it's reasonable
18:28:38 <kohsuke> I think making Jenkins skills marketable is good for us
18:29:43 <kohsuke> All right, I think that's good enough for now given the attendance
18:29:56 <kohsuke> #topic next meeting
18:30:20 <kohsuke> The next meeting will be in two weeks, as usual
18:30:32 <kohsuke> #endmeeting
