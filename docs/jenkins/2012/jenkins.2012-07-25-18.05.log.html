<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">18:07:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> Thanks :-)
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">18:07:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> So, Hi, I'm Tony Lampada, I'm a software engineer, and I use Jenkins for 3+ years now
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">18:08:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> Me and my associate, Arthur Casals, are working  on a project called FreedomSponsors,
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">18:08:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> (Arthur, are you here?)
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">18:08:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> So...
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">18:08:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> Brief explanation about FreedomSponsors:
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">18:08:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;acasals&gt;</span> Barely, but yes - hi
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">18:09:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> FS is a crowdfunding platform for open source projects. Specifically, open source project's issues.
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">18:09:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> It lets anyone place small money bounties for open issues that they are interested, like I did here --&gt; http://www.freedomsponsors.org/core/issue/11/make-openid-work-with-google-apps-accounts
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">18:09:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> The so called "sponsors" will only be asked to pay their offer after the issue is resolved.
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">18:09:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> If they're happy with the solution, they pay it directly to the developer.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">18:09:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> That's the short story. The long story is here --&gt; http://www.freedomsponsors.org/core/about/
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">18:09:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wild_oscar&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tonylampada:</span> interesting. I had an argument with the developers of darktable the other day regarding this
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">18:10:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> We started this project as a way of stimulating the growth of open-source projects by
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">18:10:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> (i) getting more people involved (both users and developers) and
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">18:10:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> (ii) delivering extra help (issue solving and funding).
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">18:10:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> We believe we can promote and increase open-source colaboration by users and developers at the same time;
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">18:10:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> Our next step is to create a Jira plugin (already in development) to be used as an integration tool;
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">18:10:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> It will add a "Sponsor issue" to the issue screen, that will open an iframe pointing to FS, as described here --&gt; http://www.freedomsponsors.org/core/issue/12/jira-plugin-to-link-from-tickets-to-freedomsponsors
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">18:10:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wild_oscar&gt;</span> would be interesting if it were associated with stackoverflow
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">18:10:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> We are hoping that Jenkins will accept to be the first to use it. :-)
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">18:11:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Definitely interesting.
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">18:11:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> (that's the end of the FS presentation text we had prepared) :-)
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">18:11:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lov&gt;</span> that sounds pretty neat
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">18:12:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;seanh-corona&gt;</span> is the join plugin the recommended way to manage more than one build and collect all the artifacts in one place? or is there a better way to manage a multijob type setup?
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">18:12:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> Thanks :-)
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">18:12:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Well, I don't think we can commit to anything without Kohsuke here, but I don't see a problem with the idea.
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">18:12:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> seems like FS should just link to the jenkins jira, not the other way around
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">18:12:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> seanh-corona, we're in the middle of a project meeting. This one should be quick, so please hold your question for a little bit longer.
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">18:12:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;seanh-corona&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span>  sorry, didn't realize
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">18:13:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> jieryn, it already works that way. The plugin would make the connection "bidirectional"
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">18:13:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">The FreedomSponsors proposal is to have Jenkins JIRA embed the "Sponsor this ticket" badge.</span>
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">18:13:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> have FS attach a label like 'bounty' or something
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">18:13:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> why does it need to be bidirectional?
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">18:13:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> i dunno, we just have a lot of problems with jira already, and adding more plugins .. :)
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">18:13:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> Please take a look at this FS ticket:
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">18:14:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> --&gt;  http://www.freedomsponsors.org/core/issue/11/make-openid-work-with-google-apps-accounts
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">18:14:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> yah, i already read that
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">18:14:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> It has a "View original issue" link that points to Jenkins JIRA
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">18:14:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> i'm saying, from FS, i tell it to scan my issues, or i plugin in an existing issue #
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">18:14:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> then it can add a comment saying there is a new bug bounty
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">18:15:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> So a question of what's the optimal workflow for sponsoring a bounty.
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">18:16:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> aesthetically and architecturally, i don't think i have anything better than neutral opinion about making jenkins jira be the launch zone for a FS bounty
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">18:16:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> As a Jenkins user, I would be more likely to interact with our JIRA than go to the FS site, which I may or may not have heard of.
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">18:16:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">18:16:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lov&gt;</span> ^^
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">18:16:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> But JIRA stability is a real concern.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">18:16:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> Yes. jieryn, that sounds like an improvement to the current workflow, and the new workflow that will be in place when the plugin is installed
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">18:16:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> How responsive would you guys be able to be if there were problems?
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">18:17:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> Probably would be able to address problems in less than 24h
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">18:18:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> <span class="hi">@hare_brain:</span> That's what I think too.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">18:18:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> i think a demo would be great, maybe a month long pilot or something.. then re-eval ? i dunno
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">18:19:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn&gt;</span> getting $ for work seems nice :)
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">18:19:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;zyltoid&gt;</span> no ways
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">18:19:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Yeah - a demo at the next meeting would be great. rtyler and kohsuke do most of the JIRA admin, so they're the ones who'd really need to be comfortable adding it.
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">18:19:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> Sure thing jieryn, we'll have a demo up shortly
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">18:20:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tonylampada&gt;</span> should this be adde as an "# action" ? :-)
