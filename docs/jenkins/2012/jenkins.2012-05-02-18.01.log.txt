18:01:55 <robobutler> Let the Jenkins meeting commence!
18:01:57 <abayer> I'm a bit distracted/busy - only gonna be able to give partial attention. Sorry.
18:02:22 <kohsuke> There isn't any real agenda for today
18:02:33 <kohsuke> Partially due to the mix up in the schedule
18:02:46 <kohsuke> #topic recap of actions
18:03:04 <kohsuke> #info I've sent keys to the rest of the board, so the bus factor is no longer 1
18:03:33 <kohsuke> ndeloof: I don't know if JProfiler license made progress
18:04:04 <kohsuke> #info and folks, please submit CLA
18:04:18 <kohsuke> looks like I've got 2 pending pull requests that need to be merged there
18:04:57 <kohsuke> aside from that, I think I'm just going to schedule the next meeting and call this week done
18:05:21 <kohsuke> #topic next time
18:06:47 <kohsuke> The usual time would be 5/16
18:07:15 <kohsuke> but I'll be travelling, and I suspect there won't be that much to discuss anyway, given the past month
18:07:31 <kohsuke> I wonder if we should skip one time and set next to be 5/30?
18:07:34 <kohsuke> abayer: ^^
18:07:41 <abayer> works for me.
18:07:41 <kohsuke> (that's 4 weeks from now)
18:08:10 <abayer> If issues come up that need to be addressed before then,w e can try to do a meeting without you on 5/16, but I doubt it'll be needed.
18:08:10 <kohsuke> #agreed the next one will be 5/30, 4 weeks from now, the usual time
18:08:30 <kohsuke> #agreed If issues come up that need to be addressed before then,w e can try to do a meeting without you on 5/16
18:08:50 <kohsuke> all right, I think I'll call it a wrap unless someone else wants to discuss something
