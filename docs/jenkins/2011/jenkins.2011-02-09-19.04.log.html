<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">19:04:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">mwalling:</span> No, you're right.

<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">19:05:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">So a while back, I pushed the idea of separating plugins from core in JIRA, so that we could actually use fix versions on core at the very least. This never got done, because I, well, never did it.</span>
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">19:05:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">The subject has come up again on the mailing list and seems to have a lot of support.</span>
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">19:06:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mwalling&gt;</span> i support that idea, contingent on jenkins-admin being able to support it
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">19:06:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> when you say separating, you mean into separate projects right?
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">19:06:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Yes.
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">19:06:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn-w&gt;</span> core / plugins / infra   ?
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">19:06:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn-w&gt;</span> or 1:1 plugin:jira proj  ?
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">19:06:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Something like that, yeah.
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">19:06:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Nooooo, that's insane and hard to pull off.
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">19:07:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> oh, I thought you mean "jabber plugin project" in JIRA
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">19:07:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">For starters, I think we're only talking about one project for Jenkins core, one project for Jenkins plugins, one project for Jenkins infrastructure. Eventually, a separate project for some individual plugins may make sense, but that's a *lot* of work to get going right off the bat.</span>
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">19:07:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn-w&gt;</span> i think ideally we would have 1 for 1, but as stated, it'd be sadistic to make volunteers support that kind of infrastructure headache
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">19:08:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mwalling&gt;</span> can jira programaticly create projects?
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">19:08:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tom_huybrechts&gt;</span> how hard  is it to create a project in jira ? (just asking, have no idea)
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">19:08:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Yeah. We're going to need help getting core/plugins split (given my limited time right now due to actual work) - maintaining versions, etc for 300 projects would be a little hellish.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">19:09:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn-w&gt;</span> i think this is a good start, let's do this in phases
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">19:09:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> what if there's a concept of promotiong
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">19:09:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">tom_huybrechts:</span> Not very, but with a lot of projects, you clutter the UI, you have to either give admin access to each plugin developer so that they can create new versions or have the admins do that by hand, etc...
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">19:09:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> by default all plugins are components in the "plugins" project, if there's enough activity/demand, they can be promoted out
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">19:09:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rtyler:</span> I kind of tend to think we should first split to core/plugin/infra, and then see hwo that works out.
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">19:10:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> some plugins receive very little attention, others receive boatloads
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">19:10:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> And then see if we want to start promoting plugins, etc.
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">19:10:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;redsolo&gt;</span> FYI, there is a CLI for jira that allows to automate the project creation
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">19:10:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;tom_huybrechts&gt;</span> if we could do it just for those plugins developers that ask, and then delegate project admininstration to him...
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">19:10:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;redsolo&gt;</span> but im happy to have one separate for core itself as well, as core is the one that needs a version nr
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">19:11:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#idea </span><span class="cmdline">Split into three projects to start (core, plugins, infra), see how that goes, and then review after a couple months to see if we want to start moving on plugins getting their own projects, etc.</span>
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">19:11:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;rtyler&gt;</span> sounds good to me
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">19:11:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;larrys&gt;</span> And don't forget SECURITY
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">19:11:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;larrys&gt;</span> for sensitive reports.
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">19:11:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">larrys:</span> Good point. that one won't go away.
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">19:12:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn-w&gt;</span> the other aspect to jira discussion is the resolved-&gt;closed debate

<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">19:12:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Ok then.

This is there basically just because java.net's Issuezilla setup had it, and so when I did the migration, I added verified so that we didn't have to mess with bug status.</span>

<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">19:18:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;wolfs&gt;</span> Should there be a review step in Jira?
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">19:18:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">wolfs:</span> code review or end-user review?

<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">19:18:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Code review we want to get in place - that's a big TODO.
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">19:19:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn-w&gt;</span> if kk ships code to address a jira, but the problem still happens - then it technically is a new problem because there's new code which is triggering it
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">19:19:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;jieryn-w&gt;</span> so i think that warrants a new jira
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">19:19:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> But that'd just be for core.

<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">19:19:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;mwalling&gt;</span> sounds like the has_patch trac flag that django uses
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">19:19:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;larrys&gt;</span> We got into a situation where we worked on changing our internal jira structure, and we quickly evolved into a huge massively complex workflow that became too clerical since it had steps that did not apply to everything… We started using the Labels plugin to mark other things on the issues...
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">19:19:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;redsolo&gt;</span> I think that is done before an issue is resolved
