<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">21:02:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> kohsuke, I started it.
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">21:03:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So the first topic was the JIRA split discussion, but
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">21:03:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> aheritier has sent in his regret, so we'll skip that one for now

<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">21:05:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I believe the interim board is willing to accept the offer from CloudBees to fund the registration, in the interest of getting it going quickly

<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">21:05:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> ... contingent on getting a paper in place that the trademark will *NOT* be owned by CB

<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">21:05:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Yes
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">21:05:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And I believe abayer had a conversation with Sacha, CB CEO, and that this is not a problem
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">21:06:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Ahyup.
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">21:06:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">so the action is for me to finally get the ball rolling</span>
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">21:06:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And the process itself should be fairly straight-forward.
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">21:06:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So I apologize for a slow progress, but a progress is being made
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">21:07:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Darn, I forgot to use the #info tag
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">21:07:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Anyway.
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">21:07:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Any questions about this topic?
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">21:07:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Or shall we move on?

<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">21:08:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, next topic...
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">21:08:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">SFC response / umbrella org</span>
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">21:08:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">So I pinged SFC again, and they said they are still reviewing applications.</span>
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">21:08:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I believe it's not just ours but others' as well
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">21:09:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">In the mean time, I pinged SPI as well</span>
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">21:09:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> http://www.spi-inc.org
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">21:09:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And got a favorable first set of replies
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">21:09:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">Also, Kohsuke and I had an informal sitdown with Doug Cutting of ASF last week.</span>
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">21:09:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes.
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">21:10:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And Doug said ASF would be very happy to have us
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">21:10:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">so the good news is that we have some orgs that are willing to take us</span>
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">21:11:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So the question is, how should we proceed?
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">21:11:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I think we should investigate all our options thoroughly.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">21:11:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I personally lean towards ASF, but not to the exclusion of other options by any means.
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">21:12:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#idea </span><span class="cmdline">So I guess we should explore SPI bit further, too, then</span>
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">21:12:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">21:12:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I think we should aim at making an educated decision as to which way to go by end of April.
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">21:12:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> SFC said they'd get something back to us by then, I believe.
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">21:12:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think we should also write down our conversation with Doug, the points raised, etc
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">21:12:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> AGreed.
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">21:13:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Aiming to build the similar write up for SPI might be a good way to drive this
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">21:13:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Yes, I'm interested in seeing what he had to say.
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">21:13:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And SFC, too.
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">21:13:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> OK, that's clearer
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">21:14:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think those are the only organizations that we are considering, right?
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">21:14:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I don't know of any other real options.
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">21:14:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> do you know others ?
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">21:14:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> one other option is to go alone, though I see the benefits of an umbrella
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">21:14:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Something to think about is these foundations each stand for something, and seem to expect their projects to be representative of those principles.
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">21:14:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Oh, I think you had a suggestion of the Dojo foundation
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">21:14:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> So the question to us is, what does Jenkins stand for, and how well does that mesh with each of these?
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">21:15:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">_W_:</span> Yeah, I admit to strongly wanting to get under an umbrella - I'd really like to get the legal support, infrastructure etc without having to run them ourselves.
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">21:15:25 </span><span class="nka">* _W_</span> <span class="ac">nods</span>
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">21:15:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Regarding Dojo, only because I stumbled across in when I was researching something else. I don't really know anything about them.
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">21:15:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">hare_brain:</span> I think in case of Apache I understands that they have certain principles
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">21:15:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I suspect it's less true for SFC and SPI
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">21:16:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> But I agree with later part of "what does Jenkins stand for, and how well does that mesh with each of these?"
<a name="l-70"></a><span class="tm">21:16:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> I can't tell if they're interested in accepting any project, or if they're only interested in projects related to Javascript tools.
<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">21:16:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> You can get infrastructure support from many places (e.g: Codehaus)
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">21:18:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think some kind of legal entity is needed for us to hold assets on behalf of the project
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">21:18:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> magnayn the infra stuff is not the most important IMHO : trademark legal stuff is more important
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">21:18:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Yes.
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">21:18:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">olamy:</span> +1
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">21:18:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I really don't want to have to deal with registering a nonprofit myself, etc. =)
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">21:18:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> ack
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">21:18:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> ack - but if infra is an issue it doesn't have to drive the decision
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">21:19:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">21:19:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">21:19:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> Very true. It's more of a nice bonus.
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">21:19:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Although being a guy involved in that infra work, it sure is a nice bonus
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">21:20:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;phyto&gt;</span> re an earlier conversation an org that gives you some infra might help the remote testing effort
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">21:20:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> but moving to asf infra will means moving some infra stuff (git etc ...)
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">21:20:53</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I should add that to the topic --- rtyler isn't here but we can report about some of our recent progress in getting hardware
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">21:21:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">olamy:</span> away from github? ugh..
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">21:21:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Do people think it'd be worth sending a quick email to the Dojo foundation to find out if they take projects outside JavaScript/HTML stuff?
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">21:21:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> On one hand, I feel like we have enough choices already,
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">21:21:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmcdonald&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> as an apache committer already, you should know how it works
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">21:22:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> but OTOH, it does seem to do the kind of things we want and doesn't do kind of things we don't want
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">21:22:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmcdonald:</span> Yes, I think there are many Apache committers here, many more active than I am, that we have good sense of what Apache Jenkins would mean
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">21:23:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">http://dojofoundation.org/about/hundredpoint</span>

<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">21:23:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">21:23:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmcdonald&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> does jenkins.apache.org appeal , becuase at ASF thats all the branding you will get
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">21:24:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> I think there are various appeals and there are some concerns
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">21:24:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmcdonald&gt;</span> everything is to be ASL v2.0 licensed and ASF as a foundation own copyright
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">21:24:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">gmcdonald:</span> why don't we let abayer and I create a Wiki page first because it answers many of the questions you are raising
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">21:25:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmcdonald&gt;</span> as an infra committer at ASF I know you would be looked after well
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">21:25:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> We've discussed those aspects in the past meetings, and I think having a page would help focusing the conversation
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">21:25:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;gmcdonald&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> sure, thanks
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">21:26:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Now, where is my agenda page...
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">21:26:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> CLA
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">21:26:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">CLA</span>
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">21:27:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> Which sort of dovetails into the foundation discussion anyway.
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">21:27:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> indeed
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">21:27:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> True
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">21:27:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And I still haven't caught up on that thread yet
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">21:27:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> first question, just since I'm not 100% on this; are there parts of the intellectual property in the core that is not owned by people now involved in Jenkins?
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">21:28:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> Yes.
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">21:28:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> For example, Oracle owns copyright on a considerable portion of the source code.
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">21:28:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> In fact, they own at least shared copyright on everything in core up until not too long ago.
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">21:28:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> And that actually might make it hard to change the license.
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">21:29:07 </span><span class="nka">* _W_</span> <span class="ac">nods</span>
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">21:29:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> given they're not so friendly..
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">21:29:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> changing the license, getting copyright assignments, seems to be a moot point because of this
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">21:29:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;prusswan&gt;</span> it's currently MIT right?
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">21:29:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> According to Doug Cutting, it's not a problem for going to Apache - the old code would remain as is, with new changes made under the new license.
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">21:29:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;hare_brain&gt;</span> OK. Good to know.
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">21:29:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> abayer, did he ok that from a legal standpoint?
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">21:29:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> So yeah, going somewhere that would require full copyright reassignment wouldn't be an option.
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">21:29:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> derivative work status etc?
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">21:29:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#info </span><span class="cmdline">So yeah, there's no conversation of changing the license for the existing code</span>
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">21:30:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">_W_:</span> He said that was Apache policy.
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">21:30:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> We just can't do it.
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">21:30:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;olamy&gt;</span> so those code need to have double licenses when we change it ?
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">21:30:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> abayer, that probably means their lawyers have looked at it, indeed

<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">21:31:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Right now, you should just make sure your changes have attribution.
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">21:31:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> ? Not sure how that would be?
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">21:32:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> put another way - what benefit can be gained by the *partial* copyright being assigned to one entity ?

<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">21:32:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> also, what would be the point of *requiring* CA - if some code is OK not being assigned, why can't more such code be added?
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">21:33:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Ok, I'm not an expert on the CA stuff by a long shot. I just know that a good number of companies require that open source projects have them before letting their employees contribute. That's the only reason I care.
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">21:33:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> (independent of whatever demands Apache has, of course)
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">21:33:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> IANAL, but the model we are trying to get to is that all the code are covered by some CLA.
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">21:33:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> ISTM the only benefit of CA is ability to easily relicense. But that's not possible becuse of the (c) owned by Oracle

<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">21:40:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> abayer, as I said in the mailing list, while I am opposed to requiring a CLA, I have no objections to letting people sign one and contribute under it - even encouraging people to do so - if that is what it takes to placate lawyers
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">21:41:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> abayer, but from what you say, you can't contribute to Jenkins anyway, since you aren't likely to get a CLA from Oracle

<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">21:42:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> Fringe benefit : If jenkins has no CLA, Jenkins can take contribs to Hudson core, but not vice-versa... :-)

<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">21:43:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> Since Cloudera (my employer) technically owns my output, they want protection, etc.

<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">21:45:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> as a contributor, I have long ago considered whether I am willing to sign any such agreement, and have come down on a solid "no" - reasons for not contributing to JAXB and Hudson under Oracle
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">21:46:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> kohsuke, it is possible to take a more empirical approach
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">21:46:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lifeless:</span> ok, but there'd have to be stipulated compensation (e.g If I infringed an MPEG2 patent...)
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">21:46:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> since none of us are lawyers, we can emulate those that have lawyers - and those that do don't uniformly go for CLA
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">21:46:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> <span class="hi">_W_:</span> OK, so in your case us requiring a CLA would be a deal breaker for you, whereas for magnayn, it's something he can live with.
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">21:46:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> I want it to be as easy as possible for people to contribute, and I want to have as large a pool of possible contributes as we can, but I think it's improtant to remember that many of us aren't able to make decisions on the CLA thing due to our employers.
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">21:47:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lifeless&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> thats not the sort of the a cla could help a contributor with - but what it could is if the *project* violated a patent, then the contributors that *didn't* add the violation could be insulated
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">21:47:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">abayer:</span> That's only an argument for an optional CLA though
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">21:47:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lifeless&gt;</span> <span class="hi">magnayn:</span> you'd need a entity with pockets etc through
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">21:47:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;abayer&gt;</span> And I also think it's important to remember that when I say I'm for having a CLA (and if optional's all we need, hey, that's fine with me - but I don't know if that's the case), I'm not saying I agree with CLAs, etc.
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">21:47:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">lifeless:</span> agreed. Which is why it's always the customers who get sued, not the developers (SCO, Linux)
<a name="l-216"></a><span class="tm">21:47:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lifeless&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> FWIW Canonical has no issue signing CLA's and CA for its staff (assuming sane CLA's) for open source projects

<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">21:49:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So I was under the assumption that our impact on the possible contributor base is small, even if the paperwork overhead is annoying
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">21:49:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;magnayn&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> It's mostly because the Apache CLA is not countersigned, and therefore legally worthless..

<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">21:49:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;_W_&gt;</span> I do have a compromise I would likely agree to contribute under as well - me writing public domain code, and others (who have signed a CLA) integrating it to the core, much like any other third party dependency
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">21:50:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;lifeless&gt;</span> <span class="hi">kohsuke:</span> I would probably have waited until I had most or all of my changes done a year+ago rather than contributing them back - because getting a CLA signed is an interrupt to legal - its several hundred dollars of staff time all told

<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">21:55:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> AIU, we are getting two more boxes on OSUOSL for the project
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">21:55:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> And we got another server VM from Rackspace

<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">21:56:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> it's really running out of memory, causing instability
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">21:57:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;kohsuke&gt;</span> So we are planning to move one of the services to a new machine to solve the situation
