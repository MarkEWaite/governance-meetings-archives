18:03:06 <kohsuke> Well
18:03:15 <kohsuke> It looks like there's not even an agenda list for today
18:03:28 <kohsuke> ogondza: do you have anything specific?
18:03:38 <kohsuke> I know daniel is in the air and tyler is busy today
18:03:57 <ogondza> nothing noteworthy, except that LTS is almost empty
18:04:25 <ogondza> kohsuke, I have done all I see necessary to get the packaginng-ref.txt ready for your consumption
18:04:32 <ogondza> so it should work
18:04:49 <ogondza> FYI, we decided to ship packaging master
18:04:52 <rtyler> o/
18:04:53 <kohsuke> ogondza: thanks, and if it doesn't work the fix is easy
18:05:17 <ogondza> kohsuke, I was mostly concerned about the consuming part on your end as that i shinned from us/me
18:05:18 <kohsuke> LTS is almost empty because the quality of bits are so great we didn't nee dany backporting!?!?
18:05:28 <ogondza> but it should be ok, i guess
18:05:42 <kohsuke> Yes, it's been working for the main line
18:05:42 <ogondza> it is because we picked recent baseline, I am affraid
18:05:49 <ogondza> :)
18:06:10 <ogondza> anyway, I think the bits are good to go
18:06:16 <kohsuke> That's what I figured
18:06:18 <kohsuke> OK
18:06:44 <kohsuke> Anything else?
18:06:56 <ogondza> not on the topic
18:07:05 <kohsuke> Otherwise we can aim for breaking the record of fastest project meeting
18:07:27 <ogondza> would be a shame no to try that
18:07:48 <kohsuke> All right then
