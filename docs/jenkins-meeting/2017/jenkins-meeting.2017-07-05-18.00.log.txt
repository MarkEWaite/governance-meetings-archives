18:00:38 <rtyler> #topic last meeting actions
18:00:49 <rtyler> the only real action was to release 2.60.1
18:00:53 <rtyler> which does appear to have happened \o/
18:01:15 <ogondza> it did indeed
18:01:34 <rtyler> #topic LTS status update
18:02:01 <ogondza> t issues backported: https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-18578?jql=labels%20%3D%202.60.2-fixed
18:02:03 <rtyler> ogondza: all you buddy
18:02:06 <ogondza> the ATH looks good
18:02:20 <ogondza> we are ready to get the RC pushed
18:02:41 <ogondza> which I will do unless there are objections ...
18:03:13 * rtyler listens to the crickets chirping
18:03:19 <ogondza> (I am not in the office tomorrow anyway, so will do it right after the meeting)
18:03:26 <ogondza> ... and we can move on
18:03:41 * kohsuke joins the meeting a little late
18:03:47 <rtyler> #action ogondza to push the next LTS RC
18:04:01 <rtyler> that's really all there is today ogondza :)
18:04:08 <rtyler> there's nothing else on the agenda
18:04:16 <kohsuke> And I'll make sure not to screw up the release next time!
18:04:21 <rtyler> heh
18:04:39 <rtyler> anything else before I wrap this up?

18:04:56 * rtyler waits patiently
18:05:04 <kohsuke> ogondza: I'm going to miss not seeing you in Jenkins World.
